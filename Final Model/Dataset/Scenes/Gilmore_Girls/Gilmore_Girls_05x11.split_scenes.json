        "[Luke and Lorelai are asleep. Lorelai wakes up and leans toward Luke.]",
        "LORELAI: Hey. Wake up.",
        "LUKE: Huh?",
        "LORELAI: Wake up.",
        "LUKE: No.",
        "LORELAI: Come on, you're missing it.",
        "LUKE: Is \"it\" sleep? 'Cause you'd be right.",
        "LORELAI: Smell the air. Smell it.",
        "[She pulls the blankets off him.]",
        "LUKE: It smells cold.",
        "LORELAI: Come on.",
        "LUKE: What? No, it's freezing.",
        "LORELAI: Come on!",
        "[She pulls him out of bed.]",
        "LUKE [grunting]: The floor's cold.",
        "LORELAI: Geez, you're so obsessed with the cold.",
        "LUKE: Because it's cold!",
        "LORELAI: I know.",
        "[Luke growls.]",
        "LORELAI [mimicking]: Grumble, grumble.",
        "[She leads him out the door.]",
        "STAR'S HOLLOW STREET - OUTSIDE LUKE'S",
        "[Lorelai walks to the middle of the street and stops. Luke follows grudgingly.]",
        "LUKE: I'm turning numb.",
        "LORELAI: Keep moving.",
        "LUKE: Are my feet still attached to my body or did they snap off coming down the stairs?",
        "LORELAI [looks]: They're still there.",
        "LUKE: Why are we out here?",
        "LORELAI: Take a deep breath.",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: Do it.",
        "LUKE: Yeah.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yeah. I smell snow.",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: It's coming. I always know. I can smell it, and I'm never wrong.",
        "LUKE: It wasn't in the forecast.",
        "LORELAI [sighs happily]: It's just my favorite time of the year. The whole world changes color.",
        "LUKE: I think I'm blacking out.",
        "LORELAI: Flakes, flurries, swirls, crystals, whatever form it comes in. I'll take it. We go back, snow and me. We have a beautiful history.",
        "LUKE: Saw two forecasts, there was no mention of snow. Cold, but no snow.",
        "LORELAI: Sleigh rides, ice skating, snowball fights. I'll even take curling. God, I love curling!",
        "LUKE: Lance Cranston on Channel 6 said it would be dry. Kimmy Liston, Live at 5, same thing. No snow, nothing.",
        "LORELAI: Hot cocoa, hot toddies. Best time of the year!",
        "LUKE: Jimmy Mountain in Accu-Chopper One said it would be weeks before -",
        "[He stops and looks up as the snow starts to fall.]",
        "LUKE: Lance and Kimmy are idiots.",
        "LORELAI: Welcome, friend.",
        "LUKE: I'm going inside now.",
        "LORELAI: But -",
        "LUKE: One more whiff, and then so are you.",
        "LORELAI: Luke -",
        "[Luke pulls away and walks back into the diner. Lorelai smiles as she looks up at the snow falling.]",

        "LUKE'S DINER",
        "[A group of town men are sitting around a table.]",
        "ANDREW: Streetwalker.",
        "TAYLOR: Too urban.",
        "MAN #1: Concubine.",
        "MAN #2: Seems high-falutin.",
        "REVEREND: Anyone seen Farewell My Concubine? Beautiful film. Gorgeous cinematography.",
        "TAYLOR: I'm surprised you see such adult fare, Reverend.",
        "REVEREND: Well, do you picture me watching Sound of Music every night, Taylor? Gag me.",
        "[Luke comes over with a coffee pot.]",
        "MAN #2: Scarlet woman.",
        "TAYLOR: I like it.",
        "ANDREW: Too Nathaniel Hawthorne.",
        "LUKE: Who?",
        "ANDREW: Read a book.",
        "MAN #1: Harlot.",
        "MAN #2: Naw.",
        "REVEREND: Woman of accomadating morals.",
        "MAN #1: Too long",
        "ANDREW: Hot mutton.",
        "TAYLOR: I wouldn't know where to begin.",
        "LUKE: What are you guys doing?",
        "TAYLOR: Well, the first snow has come along, Luke, and with the first snow comes the town's Revolutionary War Re-enactment.",
        "LUKE: Always a heel-clicking good time.",
        "TAYLOR: Oh, well, we've got a big surprise for everybody this year.",
        "LUKE: Great, I'll pretend I'm interested.",
        "REVEREND: It's a big deal, Luke.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, it's the same thing every year, Reverend. You guys re-enact the time a bunch of pig-headed morons stood outside all night in the freezing snow waiting for a battle that never happened.",
        "MAN #1: This year is different, crank.",
        "TAYLOR: A local historian uncovered new evidence of Star's Hollow's participation in the Revolution. Apparently, an English battalion was awaiting the return of their commanding general with plans for a big battle. Our soldiers caught wind of this and blocked the high road so that the general had to travel by the lower road, through town, to reach his troops.",
        "LUKE: So, they kidnapped him.",
        "[The men laugh.]",
        "TAYLOR: No, they were much slyer than that. They had a brave lady of the town use her wiles to draw the general to her rooms and keep him occupied. That delayed the general's arrival which allowed Lafayette the opportunity to ambush the waiting British troops.",
        "LUKE: A hooker stopped a battle.",
        "MAN #2: We're not calling her a hooker.",
        "REVEREND: It's too \"Baretta\".",
        "MAN #1: That's what we're doing now, trying to figure out what the hell to call her.",
        "ANDREW: Bit of stuff.",
        "MAN #1: Too Monty Python.",
        "TAYLOR: This new re-enactment is going to be a huge boost to tourism, Luke. The local press is all excited to cover it.",
        "LUKE: Well then they're very easily amused.",
        "TAYLOR: Got a big casting session soon to pick the lucky townswoman to play our special lady.",
        "MAN #2: She should be thin.",
        "ANDREW: But not too thin.",
        "MAN #1: Know anybody who fits the bill?",
        "LUKE: Not off-hand, but if I run into any moderately-weighted whores in my travels, I'll let you know.",
        "[He returns to the counter as Lorelai comes down the stairs.",
        "TAYLOR: Well, Patty is ready to go...",
        "LORELAI: Morning.",
        "LUKE: Good morning again.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, cool, the re-enactors are meeting. Another wonderful by-product of snow.",
        "LUKE: Oh, yes, they're cooking up something very special. You want coffee?",
        "LORELAI: No. I'm late, so I'll just grab it at the inn. I'm actually looking forward to having my first cup of joe in my new, snow covered inn and - why are the re-enactors staring at me?",
        "LUKE: You wouldn't believe it if I told you.",
        "LORELAI: The Reverend is blushing. Why is he blushing?",
        "LUKE: I'd walk out of here is I was you. And try not to walk too sexy.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. You'll explain that to me later?",
        "LUKE: I'd enjoy that.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. [She walks by the table.] Hi, guys.",
        "REVEREND [To the others]: Pretty lady.",
        "ANDREW: Too thin.",
        "MAN #2: This is not about your taste, Andrew.",
        "ANDREW: I'm going for historical accuracy's side. Women were heavier back then.",
        "MAN #1: How about your wife?",
        "MAN #2: You want a sock in the nose?",
        "ELDER GILMORE'S HOUSE",
        "{Emily is walking through the house talking on a cordless phone.]",
        "EMILY: No, no, Jean, that works perfectly with my schedule. It's been forever since we've seen each other. [pause] Oh, I'd love that! Mirabelle is still one of my favorite - oh!",
        "[She jumps back, shocked to see a shivering little white dog sitting outside.]",
        "EMILY: Oh my God! Oh my God! No, uh, Jean, hang on a second, will you?",
        "[She pushes a button on the phone. Richard's cell phone rings. He picks it up. Scene cuts between the pool house and the main house.]",
        "RICHARD: Hello?",
        "EMILY: There's a dog on the patio!",
        "RICHARD: What? Emily?",
        "EMILY: Of course it's Emily!",
        "RICHARD: I'm sorry. You sound agitated.",
        "EMILY: Did you get a dog?",
        "RICHARD: Certainly not!",
        "EMILY: Well, there's a dog on the patio.",
        "RICHARD: Well, where are you?",
        "EMILY: Inside! Richard, do something!",
        "RICHARD: I can't see it from here.",
        "EMILY: Well, he's here nonetheless, and he's looking at me! Richard, the dog is looking at me!",
        "RICHARD: Hold on.",
        "EMILY: I'm holding, but what are we going to - Richard? [To the dog] Shoo! Shoo!",
        "[Richard is out on the patio. They continue to talk on the phone.]",
        "EMILY: Now do you believe me?",
        "RICHARD: Well, I wasn't doubting you, Emily, I just couldn't see it.",
        "EMILY [pointing at the fire poker in his hand]: What is that?",
        "RICHARD: Oh, you made it sound like it was a rabid beast, so I came prepared.",
        "EMILY: Don't get too close.",
        "RICHARD: I don't see any froth on his mouth.",
        "EMILY: Well, that's something.",
        "RICHARD: I see a collar but no tags. That isn't very smart.",
        "EMILY: You're getting too close.",
        "RICHARD: Well, what should I do? It's freezing out here. We can't let it roam around.",
        "EMILY: Well it can't come into the house.",
        "RICHARD: Why someone would fail to put a tag on a dog -",
        "EMILY: Take it to the pool house.",
        "RICHARD: What? Why?",
        "EMILY: Well, that's why we have it.",
        "RICHARD: We have a pool house for stray dogs? Love the innuendo, Emily. Fine. I will take him into the pool house.",
        "EMILY: Thank you, Richard. I came out and he was just sitting there.",
        "RICHARD: It's a he?",
        "EMILY: I don't know.",
        "RICHARD: Well, I can't get a visual from this angle.",
        "EMILY: It's not important.",
        "RICHARD: Dog! I want you to come with me. Come along, dog!",
        "[The dog gets up and follows Richard to the pool house.]",
        "EMILY: He's following you.",
        "RICHARD: Seems to be working!",
        "EMILY: Good job, Richard!",
        "INDEPENDENCE INN",
        "[Lorelai comes in the front door.]",
        "LORELAI: Hey! You know who just nipped at my nose? Jack Frost.",
        "MICHEL: Huh. You know who just nipped at my ear? Jack I-Don't-Care.",
        "LORELAI: Look outside, Michel. It's the first time we've seen the Inn blanketed by snow. It's like a postcard.",
        "MICHEL: I know. I haven't been this excited since Madonna just dropped by Total Request Live.",
        "LORELAI: The floor's a little wet, are we getting the mats out?",
        "MICHEL: We are without mats.",
        "LORELAI: That's impossible, we ordered them eight months ago. We got confirmation.",
        "MICHEL: They were back-ordered and due within two weeks. Two weeks turned into eight months, and all we have to show for it is our special yellow back-order receipt. Such cheap paper they use at the mat place. That should have been a clue.",
        "LORELAI: What else can we put down?",
        "MICHEL: Oh, plenty. I saw two movies over the weekend. They were both awful.",
        "LORELAI: No, I meant put down on the floor so our guests don't slip and fall. We have to find something.",
        "MICHEL: The good news is that there will be less people here who could possibly slip.",
        "[They walk over to the reception desk.]",
        "LORELAI: What do you mean, less people?",
        "MICHEL: We've had four cancellations in the last hour.",
        "LORELAI: Why? What happened?",
        "MICHEL: All due to snow.",
        "LORELAI: Snow? Our beautiful snow?",
        "MICHEL: People say it is cold, the streets are bad -",
        "LORELAI: The streets are fine. They're plowing away out there. A graceful, gorgeous plow was pushing the snowy white out of the street right behind me, it was beautiful.",
        "MICHEL: They wanted nice weather.",
        "LORELAI: This is nice weather. It's classic Connecticut inn weather. It's all the more reason to come.",
        "MICHEL: I would advise that you change our cancellation policy. These people cancel and have to pay nothing.",
        "LORELAI: I hate charging people for canceling. It's too corporate. We're doing things differently here.",
        "MICHEL: Oh, yes. Bankruptcy will be fun and different. Be sure to file for it while it's snowing, won't you? We'll go down to bankruptcy court in a horse-drawn sleigh.",
        "LORELAI [sighs]: Try to find mats.",
        "MICHEL: I'll do what I can.",
        "[Lorelai walks into the kitchen.]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, Sookie.",
        "SOOKIE: Good morning.",
        "LORELAI: How are you loving our winter wonderland?",
        "SOOKIE: My car wouldn't start this morning.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, drag.",
        "SOOKIE: And we're almost completely out of coffee.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, well. So, make some more.",
        "SOOKIE: I mean out, out. There's no more on the premises.",
        "LORELAI: You're kidding.",
        "SOOKIE: I wish I was.",
        "LORELAI: But there's mounds of it stacked in the walk-in. Heroin-sniffing dogs get all excited and confused when they go in there.",
        "SOOKIE: Why do they get all excited and confused?",
        "LORELAI: Because you smuggle heroin in coffee.",
        "SOOKIE [gasps]: No, I don't!",
        "LORELAI: It was in Beverly Hills Cop, remember? The heroin in the coffee? Why are you taking everything so literally?",
        "SOOKIE [whining]: My car wouldn't start!",
        "LORELAI: Since when does that make you take things literally?",
        "SOOKIE: Wait, I'm sorry, when were there dogs in the walk-in?",
        "LORELAI: I'm just saying, we had a lot of coffee. Until now, apparently.",
        "SOOKIE: 'Cause we're switching suppliers. I found that new blend, you remember? You tasted it, you said it tasted great.",
        "LORELAI: I liked it. I remember.",
        "[She pours herself some coffee.]",
        "SOOKIE: So I'm letting the old stuff run out because the new stuff's coming in but the new stuff is back-ordered, so it never came in.",
        "LORELAI: Well, send out for more, immediately.",
        "MICHEL [interrupting]: Not possible.",
        "LORELAI: Why?",
        "MICHEL: Remember those wonderful snowplows you were writing a sonnet to not five minutes ago? Well, one of them dumped a ten-foot mountain of snow in our driveway. There is no getting in or out.",
        "LORELAI: Unbelievable.",
        "MICHEL: Well, it's not so bad, because with the cancellations, no one's coming today anyway.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, but we have to get out, to go home, eventually, and to get coffee now. So start the guys digging.",
        "MICHEL: You mean I should get the one guy who did not call in sick because of the snow and the cold to get digging?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, get him digging! [Michel goes.] It's okay, it's all good. Snow will be dug and mats will be found, coffee will be bought, everything's good.",
        "SOOKIE: By the way.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "SOOKIE: There are some people out there eating breakfast, and -",
        "LORELAI: And -",
        "SOOKIE: And they're drinking coffee. [She takes the coffee cup from Lorelai and heads for the dining room.] Customers.",
        "YALE DORMS - RORY'S COMMON ROOM",
        "[Rory comes out of her room. Paris is on the couch.]",
        "RORY: Good morning.",
        "PARIS: Stupid C-span.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "PARIS: Stupid C-span's had me on hold forever and I've got to get going.",
        "RORY: Well, you're not the only one who calls C-span, Paris.",
        "PARIS: Right. There are a lot of us. Like the guy who asked the question about Iran's long-range missile production and nuclear capacity, then shouted Ba Ba Booie! Him they put on. Me they've got twiddling my thumbs.",
        "[Paris goes into her room. Rory opens the door; Christopher is standing there.]",
        "RORY: Dad.",
        "CHRIS: Hey, kiddo.",
        "RORY: What are you doing here?",
        "CHRIS: Aw, I was just in the neighborhood, I thought I'd look you up.",
        "RORY: Did you bring the baby?",
        "CHRIS: Baby's getting spoiled by her grandma. So where are you headed?",
        "RORY: I have class.",
        "CHRIS: Right. College. Classes. I've seen Oxford Blues, I should have put that together. So this is your place, huh?",
        "RORY: Yeah. It's a little messy right now. [Paris walks out of her room.] That's Paris.",
        "CHRIS: We've met. Hi, Paris.",
        "PARIS: Hello. [On the phone] Yeah, I've got a suggestion for getting you guys out of the ratings basement. And putting me on hold is not one of them.",
        "RORY: So, you were just passing through?",
        "CHRIS: Yeah, I was in the area, or the area near the area, so how about breakfast?",
        "RORY: Oh, I don't have time.",
        "CHRIS: It's the most important meal of the day.",
        "RORY: And the most skipped around here. Mornings are busy.",
        "CHRIS: Forget busy. Forget class. Play hooky, have breakfast with me. Come on. We can all go together if you want. Paris?",
        "PARIS: I am kind of hungry. And C-span can kiss my ass.",
        "CHRIS: Okay, then, we're on.",
        "RORY: Dad -",
        "CHRIS: We can walk, we can drive, whatever -",
        "RORY: Dad, no! I have to go. I can't be any clearer, okay?",
        "[She leaves Chris standing at the door and walks down the hall.]",
        "CHRIS: Rory -",
        "INDEPENDENCE INN - LOBBY",
        "[Lorelai is on the phone.]",
        "LORELAI: Well, we can certainly rebook you, because we'd love to have you come anytime. Really. But if you reconsidered your cancellation and came in now you would find nothing less than a magical wonderland. A snowy xanadu of goodness. Really. Bing Crosby's warming up his pipes over by the fireplace. Magical. [Pause] Mm-hm. Yes, driving in the snow is tricky. [Pause] No, I don't think I could get Bing Crosby to come pick you up. [Pause] Okay. Well, just check your calendar and call me back, and I'll be here to rearrange it. Thank you. Bye.",
        "[She walks toward the dining room as Michel enters wearing a furry hat and carrying a shovel. She nearly slips on the wet floor.]",
        "MICHEL [laughing]: That was very graceful.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I'm desperate for those mats.",
        "MICHEL: I had been working on the mats but you asked me to shovel the snow. And now I have a blister, a muscle spasm and a neck crick and I have a date tonight, and a crick will cramp my kissing move.",
        "[They go into the dining room. Lorelai clears dishes while Michel removes his outerwear.]",
        "LORELAI: Well, I appreciate your effort.",
        "MICHEL: Are you being sarcastic?",
        "LORELAI: Just a tiny bit.",
        "MICHEL: You know that I am light-boned and cannot take physical exertion. I work with my mind.",
        "LORELAI: Well, you're excused from shoveling duty, just focus on the mats.",
        "MICHEL: We have another problem. The Goldfarbs are missing.",
        "LORELAI: The Goldfarbs? Our Goldfarbs?",
        "MICHEL: The ones you recommended to go cross-country skiing this morning.",
        "LORELAI: Right. So they're out skiing.",
        "MICHEL: They said they would be back by noon promptly. Well, it's past noon, and their friends are here to meet them for lunch, but the Goldfarbs are erwol.",
        "LORELAI: They're what?",
        "MICHEL: Erwol! Erwol!",
        "LORELAI: Oh! AWOL.",
        "MICHEL: What do I care. I'm French. The point is, we strapped wooden sticks to the feet of a fat orthodontist and a woman with ugly chunky jewelry, and we lost them.",
        "LORELAI: Oh my God, it's only noon!",
        "MICHEL: Can I call the authorities?",
        "LORELAI: You think we're there already?",
        "[Sookie comes out with a bussing tray to pick up the dishes.]",
        "SOOKIE: What are you doing?",
        "LORELAI: Cleaning up. [To Michel] No, let's wait another twenty minutes, just keep calling their cell phone.",
        "MICHEL: Oh, joy.",
        "[Lorelai pours a bit of coffee from one cup into another.]",
        "SOOKIE: Ugh! Please tell me you're not doing what I think you're doing.",
        "LORELAI: What? I'm just cleaning up. We're short-handed today. Go about your business.",
        "SOOKIE [disgusted]: You were pouring leftover coffee from other people's cups into your own cup and now you're going to drink it!",
        "LORELAI: No, no, no!",
        "SOOKIE [grabbing]: Give me that cup!",
        "LORELAI: No! Get away! Don't you understand if I don't get coffee in me, things are going to get ugly around here!",
        "SOOKIE: Going to get?",
        "MICHEL: Be very careful! She's near a knife!",
        "SOOKIE [obtains the cup]: Give me that. I'm ashamed of you.",
        "LORELAI: I'm ashamed of me too.",
        "SOOKIE: If that wasn't a cry for help, huh.",
        "LORELAI: I'm going out.",
        "MICHEL: The driveway's still blocked.",
        "LORELAI: On foot.",
