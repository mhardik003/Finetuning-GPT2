        "(OPEN in Lorelai and Luke's bedroom, night. PA is sleeping at the foot of the bed and Luke and Lorelai are sleeping in it. Suddenly bells start ringing, and the couple wakes up startled)",
        "LORELAI: Oh, my god!",
        "LUKE: What is that?",
        "LORELAI: What is...Is it in the house?",
        "LUKE: It's church bells.",
        "LORELAI: Whe...How'd the church bells get in the house?",
        "LUKE: They're outside.",
        "LORELAI: Whe...In the yard?",
        "LUKE: No, at the church. What time is it?",
        "LORELAI: It's three twelve. Why are the church bells ringing at three twelve?",
        "LUKE: I don't know. I was having a dream, too. I was shopping for a car and I wanted to see the trunk space, and... 'cause I have a truck and it's convenient to haul things. So I wanted to see what the deal with the car was, and the salesman opened it. I asked him how many cubic feet it was and he looked it up in the manual and I was satisfied. So when he closed the hood, the bells rang.",
        "LORELAI: You have very mundane dreams.",
        "KIRK (mumbled from outside): Town meeting.",
        "LORELAI: Huh!",
        "MAN (mumbled from outside): Town meeting.",
        "LORELAI: What was that?",
        "LUKE: Some dead guy yelling something.",
        "LORELAI: Ghosts are yelling something outside the house?",
        "LUKE: No, guys I'm gonna kill yelling stuff outside the house.",
        "KIRK (mumbled from outside): Town meeting.",
        "LORELAI: What are they saying?",
        "LUKE: There was a clown beating?",
        "LORELAI: Huh! Not again.",
        "MAN (mumbled from outside): Town meeting,",
        "KIRK (clearly from outside): Town meeting.",
        "LUKE: Now, they're saying, \"town meeting\".",
        "LORELAI: Town meeting? At this hour?",
        "LUKE: What the hell is Taylor up to?",
        "(At the same time)",
        "LUKE: Lets get back to sleep.",
        "LORELAI: All right. Guess we better go.",
        "LUKE: What? I'm going back to bed.",
        "LORELAI: What? You can't go back to sleep.",
        "LORELAI: Come on, it's a town meeting.",
        "LUKE: It's the middle of the night.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, sorry, we might miss something. (Lorelai gets out of bed and starts pulling Luke's arm, he groans)",
        "(CUT to Patty's studio during the town meeting, same night. People in pj's are taking their seats around the hall as Lorelai and Luke enter)",
        "LUKE: Oh, good, full house. Just goes to show how easily manipulated we all are. You ring a bell, we drool like dogs. (they walk towards a couple of seats and sit in front of Babette)",
        "LORELAI: Just don't drool where we sit. It'll be messy.",
        "BABETTE: Hey, you guys hear the bells?",
        "LUKE: No, we were just on one of our spontaneous three-in-the-morning strolls, saw everybody in here, and wondered, \"hey, what's up?\".",
        "BABETTE: Really?",
        "LUKE: No.",
        "BABETTE: (to Lorelai) He's cranky at three in the morning.",
        "LORELAI: Any idea what this is about?",
        "BABETTE: No, Taylor's not even here yet, and Kirk's up there, futzing with something, but he won't tell us what's going on.",
        "KIRK: (from the stage, fussing with a screen) We're just about ready here, folks.",
        "LUKE: Ready for what? What is this?",
        "KIRK: Here we go. (presses a button on the screen. Taylor appears on the screen)",
        "TAYLOR (From Screen): Greetings, everyone.",
        "LORELAI: Taylor?",
        "BABETTE: He's in a little box.",
        "LUKE: The nightmare continues.",
        "TAYLOR (From Screen): Is it looking okay, Kirk?",
        "KIRK: Yeah, you could use a little pancake.",
        "PATTY: Weird. I can still smell his cologne.",
        "TAYLOR (From Screen): People, we have a tremendous problem that needs our immediate attention. That's why I chose the extraordinary step of broadcasting to you tonight from this remote location. (a ping-pong ball hits him on the head) Ow!",
        "LUKE: What was that?",
        "LORELAI: Looked like a ping-pong ball.",
        "TAYLOR (From Screen): Now, as we all know, the Annual Stars Hollow Winter Carnival is this weekend. (another ping-pong ball hits him) Ow! (turns to someone we can't see on he screen) Timmy, do not throw ping-pong balls at me.",
        "TIMMY (OS): You're a Doo-doo head.",
        "TAYLOR (From Screen): And do not call me a Doo-doo head. I'm in the middle of something important.",
        "LUKE: Where the hell are you, Taylor?",
        "TAYLOR (From Screen): I'm at my sister's in Maine. Anyway, we have never not had a Stars Hollow Winter Carnival. It's a hundred and twenty-five year tradition.",
        "LORELAI: Is he getting to the point soon?",
        "BABETTE: Yeah, come on, Doo-doo head.",
        "TAYLOR (From Screen): Fine, let's cut to the chase. I run the winter carnival, it's this weekend, and I am snowed in, unable to get back into town. (gets no reaction from the town)",
        "PATTY: So, what's this about, Taylor?",
        "TAYLOR (From Screen): Maybe it's the lateness of the hour or the computer connection isn't clear. (another ping-pong ball)",
        "TIMMY (OS): Doo-doo head!",
        "TAYLOR (From Screen): We have never had to cancel a carnival, and it's absolutely impossible for me to get back into town to run it. (Luke yawns)",
        "BABETTE: I must be tired. I'm not getting this.",
        "PATTY: It's like a riddle or something.",
        "TAYLOR (From Screen): People, are you not hearing me? I won't be there to run the carnival. Draw the obvious conclusion.",
        "PATTY: Oh, OK, I got it now.",
        "TAYLOR (From Screen): Thank you, patty.",
        "PATTY: Kirk, could you take it over?",
        "KIRK: Sure.",
        "PATTY: Great. Anything else, Taylor?",
        "TAYLOR (From Screen): Oh, well, good for you, people. I guess we don't have to cancel it after all.",
        "LORELAI: Thanks, Taylor. (to Luke. Pats his knee) Come on, let's get you to bed. (everyone starts to get up from their seats)",
        "LUKE: (as they start to exit the studio) I'm gonna fall back to sleep and dream about running Taylor over in that car I was looking at.",
        "LORELAI: Oh. Is there enough room to put his body in the trunk? (Luke nods as they exit)",
        "TAYLOR (From Screen): Now, then, I would recommend that we immediately start discussing some details. The sooner, the better is always best. Now, then, food. We'll obviously have the carnival staples. (people are no longer paying attention to Taylor and are slowly exiting the hall. It's almost empty) French dip sandwiches, corn on the cob, apple cider, et cetera. Now, we almost ran out of hot chocolate last year, so I would recommend upping the supply by 11%. Timmy! Put down that Rubik?s cube. Timmy, do not throw that Rubik?s cube at me.",
        "OPENING CREDITS",
        "(CUT to Luke's diner, morning. Luke seems very tired as he's pouring coffee to some customers)",
        "LUKE: Here...here...here.",
        "CUSTOMER 1: This was tea.",
        "LUKE: Now you got a hybrid. That's very in right now. (walks over to Lorelai's table who's drinking coffee and is going over some papers and stuff)",
        "LORELAI: I've gotten so much done this morning, it's scary.",
        "LUKE: Coffee? (walks over to a nearby table to get an empty cup)",
        "LORELAI: I already got some. I saw the sunrise. I paid all my bills. (Luke brings the cup over and starts to pour coffee) I already got some, hon. And, this is a first, I saw the beginning of Katie Couric. I don't think I've seen the first five minutes of her in my life. You know, she and Matt Lauer are much more serious in the first half-hour than they are later on. I guess that makes sense. You know, you can afford to make people sad and angry about war and the economy and stuff when they first wake up. But then, just as they're heading to the office, you leave them with a dose of Matthew McConaughey, \"people's sexiest man\", and whoosh! they're rarin' to go.",
        "LUKE: (yawing) Yeah, Matthew McConaughey always gets me rarin'. (Kirk outside is busy with the fair stuff)",
        "LORELAI: And I'm even volunteering to, um, man a booth at the carnival this year. I got a great concept, too. What about you? You got anything special planned today?",
        "LUKE: (startled and very nervous) Today? No, not today. It's a bunch of the same old, same old errands. The usual.",
        "CUSTOMER 1: Not liking my \"hybrid\".",
        "LUKE: Coming. (they peck on the lips) I'll call you later.",
        "LORELAI: (pointing at the two cups of coffee) See what you did here?",
        "LUKE: Sorry. (takes both cups and walks away)",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no, wait, I want the one I had already. Oh, well, OK.",
        "(CUT to hallway of Paris, Doyle and Rory's apartment, morning. Rory come up the stairs and stops as she notices something in front of their door. She goes over to pick it up as she nods her head disapprovingly. It's a vase of flowers. She unlocks the door)",
        "(CUT to inside apartment, continuous. Paris is working on something in flower filled apartment as Rory enters. Paris notices the flowers)",
        "PARIS: Oh, terrific. Bring 'em on in, Algernon. The more, the merrier.",
        "RORY: It's Logan's doing. What can I do? (starts to chain the door)",
        "PARIS: Tell him to stop.",
        "RORY: We're not speaking, remember?",
        "PARIS: Well, they're putting our lives in jeopardy.",
        "RORY: Oh, stop it. (walks in the apartment)",
        "PARIS: They scream bling, draw eyes to the apartment. Bad guys see roses, then they come for our diamonds.",
        "RORY: We don't have diamonds.",
        "PARIS: The Doo-Wop group doesn't know that. (as Rory is about to put the vase near the window) Yeah, by the window is good, next to the neon sign that says \"come pistol-whip us\".",
        "RORY: Fine, I'll hide them. (puts the flowers on the floor)",
        "PARIS: You know, I see Logan at the paper a few times a week. I can lean on him, make him stop.",
        "RORY: He's going to get the message eventually.",
        "PARIS: Well, he better get it quick. Between the paper and classes, I'm only home a few hours a day, and I'd rather not spend them in mortal fear. (there is a knock on the door and Paris instinctively takes cover)",
        "RORY: Paris.",
        "PARIS: (to the person outside) Yeah?",
        "MAN (OS outside the door): UPS. Got a package for Rory Gilmore.",
        "PARIS: From?",
        "MAN (OS outside the door): Harry and David.",
        "PARIS: Great. Fancy fruit.",
        "RORY: I'm sorry. (Paris walks over to the door)",
        "PARIS: Step back from the door and keep your hands where I can see them. (starts to unchain the door)",
        "(CUT to outside park, morning. The place is covered with snow. There are few people there. Two guys are throwing a frisbee around, as Luke walks up to April who's sitting on a bench her bike and bike helmet nearby)",
        "LUKE: Surprise.",
        "APRIL: Was this not a planned thing?",
        "LUKE: Why?",
        "APRIL: You said, \"surprise\".",
        "LUKE: No, it was just...just a...how you doing? (extends his hand for a shake)",
        "APRIL: Good. (she takes it and they shake hands) This is how the avian flu spreads, by the way.",
        "LUKE: Oh, sorry! (quickly takes his hand away)",
        "APRIL: I was just saying.",
        "LUKE: No, I heard that, too. Heard a guy on CNN say it.",
        "APRIL: Right. They fired my favourite, Aaron Brown. He was comforting.",
        "LUKE: Yes, he was. Mind if I sit?",
        "APRIL: No, go ahead. (Luke sits next to her. There is an awkward silence) So...do you like to hang out here?",
        "LUKE: The park? No.",
        "APRIL: Then why are we meeting here?",
        "LUKE: I thought kids liked parks.",
        "APRIL: It's 41 degrees out. Not exactly peak park-going season.",
        "LUKE: But there's still stuff to do, right? I mean, we could have a snowball fight, or something.",
        "APRIL: My friend Remi got into a snowball fight with a guy once, and she got a retina detached.",
        "LUKE: Well, we'll skip that, then. Uh...sorry. I'll think of something better to do next time, OK? I don't really know what kids are into.",
        "APRIL: Hey, whatever.",
        "LUKE: Oh, and I said \"next time\". I don't know if you caught that.",
        "APRIL: I did.",
        "LUKE: Did your mom explain that this isn't necessarily a one-time thing? I was thinking maybe we could make it semi-regular or even just, you know, regular.",
        "APRIL: Uh, OK.",
        "LUKE: Good. So, what's your free time like?",
        "APRIL: I've got no school this whole week. It's year-round, so we get weird times off.",
        "LUKE: Well, then maybe we can do something tomorrow, too, something less cold.",
        "APRIL: OK.",
        "LUKE: So, what kind of things do you like to do?",
        "APRIL: I like Morse code. I'm learning that. My mom gave me a putter, so I putt some. And I like talking to my Indian friend Shamilah in Bangalore over the internet.",
        "LUKE: I wouldn't be much help with any of that. We could bowl, or go to a movie, or maybe there's a zoo around somewhere.",
        "APRIL: How about I just come and hang out at the diner?",
        "LUKE: (shocked and nervous) What diner? My diner?",
        "APRIL: Yeah.",
        "LUKE: Won't it be boring?",
        "APRIL: No way. (Luke does not look pleased) Diners fascinate me. The hustle, the bustle, the monte cristos.",
        "LUKE: The diner?",
        "APRIL: Yeah, that'd be fun.",
        "LUKE: Can't think of anything else, huh?",
        "APRIL: I think it'd be great.",
        "LUKE: Well, OK, sure. The diner. Tomorrow you will come to the diner. (he chuckles nervously and clears his throat) So, uh, what do you want to do right now?",
        "APRIL: I've been counting how many times those frisbee guys over there have dropped it.",
        "LUKE: Uuh, OK. Let's keep watching.",
        "APRIL: The one with the hat's a big, fat butterfingers. (they watch the guys playing frisbee)",
        "(CUT to Dragonfly Inn, morning. Lorelai is signing some papers and having a conversation with Kirk)",
        "LORELAI: Kirk, you needed carnival-game volunteers and I volunteered. What's with the hassle?",
        "KIRK: We do things like ring toss and rope ladder climbing. Your choice is unorthodox.",
        "LORELAI: That's because I'm not orthodox. I'm liberal with a touch of reform and a smidgen of zippity-pow.",
        "KIRK: You're aware that this is the first time I'm running the winter carnival?",
        "LORELAI: I am aware. (they start walking to the reception desk)",
        "KIRK: I can't afford to have anything go wrong.",
        "LORELAI: Kirk, I promise! This booth will be a big hit. It will not embarrass you, OK? I promise.",
        "KIRK: Your promise means nothing to me. You break them all the time.",
        "LORELAI: (gasps) I do not.",
        "KIRK: 1997, you promised to bring me back a souvenir pen and ink set from your trip to Colonial Williamsburg.",
        "LORELAI: I...I did?",
        "KIRK: 1999, you promised to put in a good word for me at Al's Pancake World when Al had that batter boy opening.",
        "LORELAI: He calls them \"batter boys\"?",
        "KIRK: Year 2000, you promised to teach me to swim. I still don't know how to swim. What if there's a tsunami?",
        "LORELAI: Well...",
        "KIRK: 2001, you promised to come to my birthday party, and I waited and waited and...",
        "LORELAI: Kirk! Kirk, scout's honour, this booth will make you proud, OK? (as they enter the reception desk area Lorelai notices someone waiting) Now...excuse me, hi. Are you Liam Driessen by any chance?",
        "LIAM: I am.",
        "LORELAI: Hi, Lorelai Gilmore. I'm here to make your stay and the rest of the New England Maple Syrup Council's stay as comfortable as possible.",
        "LIAM: So far, so good. Love the local colour here.",
        "LORELAI: (noticing Kirk who's followed her and is standing close to them) Uh, Kirk, it's really not appropriate to be standing right next to me like this.",
        "KIRK: But we work together.",
        "LORELAI: But not here.",
        "KIRK: Liam, can I ask you a question?",
        "LORELAI: NO that's inappropriate too to ask a quest...",
        "KIRK: Would you pay a dollar to have your fortune told by a dog?",
        "LIAM: A dog?",
        "LORELAI: It's for a carnival. It's very cute.",
        "KIRK: A dog that has no previous experience telling people's fortunes?",
        "LIAM: I don't know.",
        "KIRK: Well, you're no help. (walks away)",
        "LORELAI: Well, just part of our local colour. He's purple. (nervously laughs a bit) Get it? 'Cause local colour and he's a colour. And how about a tour?",
        "LIAM: Sure. (they exit)",
        "(CUT to Yale Daily News room, morning. The staffers are working, while Paris walks around inspecting)",
        "PARIS: That's what we got?",
        "JOHNIE: Yup.",
        "PARIS: It's posed, staged. Get another and make it candid.",
        "JOHNIE: Candid?",
        "PARIS: Don't question me. (walks away and moves over to another desk)",
        "JOHNIE: But it's a team photo.",
        "PARIS: Bill, how's it hangin'?",
        "BILL: It's hanging OK.",
        "PARIS: Good, good. You like the Washington Post, do you?",
        "BILL: Yes.",
        "PARIS: Because they like to split their infinitives, at the Washington Post, especially their metro writers, but I don't.",
        "BILL: I'm not seeing...",
        "PARIS: (reading from his computer screen) \"The council member chose to forcefully waive her right of veto\".",
        "BILL: (deleting the sentence) Consider it unsplit.",
        "(Paris walks over to another desk, where a staffer is typing something. Paris pushes her aside and types something of her own, then turns to Rory who's getting ready to leave)",
        "PARIS: Hey. You check in?",
        "RORY: Check in?",
        "PARIS: The board. The new system? This is the best way for me to know where anyone is at any given time. (they walk over to a board near the door) All the names are on the left. Each coloured magnet represents an activity. If you're out on assignment, it's a red magnet. If you're in the john, it's a blue magnet. If you're at home, a purple magnet. If you're at your desk, it's a green magnet.",
        "RORY: But if they're at their desk, you can just glance over and see that they're at their desks.",
        "PARIS: But I'd have to glance all around. This saves extraneous glancing. Look, it's not really for people like you. I know you're dedicated. I trust you, but I can't appear to be playing favourites.",
        "RORY: I have a class.",
        "PARIS: Orange magnet. (Rory takes the magnet and puts in on the board next to her name. Paris looks pleased and Rory exits)",
        "(CUT to Yale hallway, continuous. Rory has just exited the newsroom. Her way is blocked by a coffee cart)",
        "RORY: (to coffee cart vender, Ben) Excuse me.",
        "BEN: You're Rory Gilmore?",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "BEN: Someone pointed you out to me. This is for you. (pointing at the coffee cart)",
        "RORY: What is?",
        "BEN: The coffee cart.",
        "RORY: For me?",
        "BEN: Courtesy of Logan Huntzberger.",
        "RORY: Oh, I see. Well, I don't want any coffee right now. (bypasses the coffee cart) Thanks anyway, and sorry you wasted your time, Ben. (starts to walk away)",
        "BEN: No problem. (Ben follows her, with the coffee cart. Rory notices)",
        "RORY: What are you doing?",
        "BEN: I'm hired for the day.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "BEN: Yep, all day. Any time you want some coffee, biscotti, I will be here.",
        "RORY: That's not necessary.",
        "BEN: I've already been paid...a lot!",
        "RORY: (sighs) Fine. (starts to walk and Ben follows her with the coffee cart)",
        "(CUT to Nardini house, night. Anna is sorting some stuff, probably for her store as we hear a TV in the backround)",
        "ANNA: Kiddo, is that the TV?",
        "APRIL (OS): Yes.",
        "ANNA: You watching something stupid?",
        "APRIL (OS): Yes.",
        "ANNA: You promise?",
        "APRIL (OS): Yes.",
        "ANNA: OK. (the telephone rings and Anna picks it up) Hello?",
        "LUKE (on phone): Hi, Anna. It's Luke.",
        "ANNA: Hey there. So, she came back with all her fingers and toes. Very successful first outing.",
        "LUKE (on phone): Yeah, it was nice. It was...it was real nice.",
        "ANNA: She had a good time, too. And that's impressive 'cause she's picky.",
        "LUKE (on phone): Good. Well, so did I.",
        "ANNA: So, she's coming by your work tomorrow?",
        "(CUT to Luke's apartment, continuous. The scene cuts between Luke's apartment and Anna at her house)",
        "LUKE: Oh, she told you that, huh? Uh...Well, listen, here's the thing. I don't know if...it's gonna work out for her to come to the diner.",
        "ANNA: Why not?",
        "LUKE: Well, it's gonna be really hectic, lots of people swooshing around and all.",
        "ANNA: She'll like that. She likes people swooshing around her.",
        "LUKE: Pans of hot grease.",
        "ANNA: There'll be pans of hot grease swooshing around her?",
        "LUKE: If she's in the kitchen, yeah.",
        "ANNA: Well, keep her out of the kitchen if there's any grease swooshing. I mean, that doesn't sound safe for you, either.",
        "LUKE: I don't even know how much time I can give her.",
        "ANNA: No problem. She's very low-maintenance. Just set her up at a table and she'll be fine.",
        "LUKE: If there's a table, because some of the tables are reserved. I've got my regulars, you know? They want their tables, so there may not be room.",
