        "In the aftermath of the Dance Marathon, Kirk parades around Stars Hollow with the trophy until someone steals it, while Lorelai and Rory painfully inch their way towards Luke's; after Lorelai tells Luke about Rory and Jess, he breaks up their first kiss as a couple and then lays down some ground rules with Jess about dating Rory; Lorelai and Rory reluctantly agree to accept Richard's invitation to accompany him and Emily to his Whiffenpoof reunion at Yale, where he springs quite an unwelcome surprise on all three women; back from New Haven, Lorelai and Rory head for Luke's, and Jess and Rory finally get to have those first kisses; Rory visits Dean to apologize and tell him that she misses his friendship; late at night, Lorelai and Rory each curl up with some bedtime reading -- the Yale brochure."

        "[Lorelai and Rory are walking slowly down the sidewalk]",
        "LORELAI: Mmkay, still walking, all's good. Huh. Mmkay.",
        "RORY: How are you?",
        "LORELAI: I should probably keep moving.",
        "RORY: God, my feet have never been in this much pain before.",
        "LORELAI: Oh yeah, what about that time?",
        "RORY: What time?",
        "LORELAI: The time when I did the thing and your feet were . . .gotta stop.",
        "RORY: Gotta sit.",
        "[they sit down on a bale of hay]",
        "RORY: Ugh. What were you saying?",
        "LORELAI: About what?",
        "RORY: About my feet.",
        "LORELAI: What about your feet?",
        "RORY: I don't know. You were talking about the thing you did to my feet.",
        "LORELAI: What thing?",
        "RORY: The thing that you. . .you and. . .huh?",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RORY: I don't know.",
        "LORELAI: Just an observation \u0096 you and I do not function well on a funky sleeping pattern.",
        "RORY: I feel jet-lagged.",
        "LORELAI: You've been up twenty-four hours straight.",
        "RORY: Yes, why did I do that?",
        "LORELAI: Because I asked you to.",
        "RORY: And that worked?",
        "LORELAI: At the time. I don't expect it to again.",
        "RORY: A realist, I like that.",
        "LORELAI: How far is Luke's?",
        "RORY: It's right over there.",
        "LORELAI: It looks far.",
        "RORY: Very far.",
        "LORELAI: Maybe if we concentrate really hard, our combined psychic powers will move it closer.",
        "[they stare at the diner]",
        "RORY: I don't think it's working.",
        "LORELAI: It's my fault, I'm not focusing.",
        "RORY: Yes, that must be why we can't move a half a city block closer to us.",
        "LORELAI: All right then, let's go. On the count of three.",
        "[Neither of them move]",
        "[opening credits]",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Lorelai and Rory walk in]",
        "LORELAI: Oh my God. Thank you.",
        "RORY: I never realized Luke's was a hundred miles away.",
        "LORELAI: We're lucky it wasn't snowing. It would've been The Donner Party all over again, but with slightly better hair. Why are you sitting over there?",
        "RORY: Where?",
        "LORELAI: At that table.",
        "RORY: Huh. How did I get here?",
        "LORELAI: You sat there.",
        "RORY: Well, this chair's very close to that chair, so you understand how I could've made the mistake.",
        "LORELAI: Move over here with me.",
        "RORY: Why don't you move over here with me?",
        "LORELAI: Because I'm not the one who sat in the wrong chair.",
        "RORY: I think it's a little presumptuous to assume that my chair is the wrong chair when my chair could just as easily be the right chair.",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "RORY: Why?",
        "LORELAI: Because I'm the leader of the clan, the provider of the household, the alpha male, and the one whose feet just fell asleep so there's absolutely no chance of movement.",
        "RORY: Fine.",
        "LORELAI: Thank you. See, it's nice sitting at the grown-up table, isn't it?",
        "RORY: Uh huh.",
        "[Kirk enters the diner carrying his dance marathon trophy]",
        "KIRK: Oh, excuse me, did my trophy bump you?",
        "LORELAI: No, Kirk, it didn't.",
        "KIRK: Good, because the size of it is so large that sometimes I can't judge where the exact end of it is.",
        "LORELAI: We're fine, Kirk.",
        "KIRK: I'm glad, because these shiny golden edges are actually very sharp. They could take an eye out or cause a deep gash completely unintentionally.",
        "LORELAI: Uh huh.",
        "KIRK: It's almost more a weapon than a trophy.",
        "LORELAI: Really? Can I hold it, then?",
        "LUKE: Get out of the way, Kirk. You're blocking the door.",
        "KIRK: Luke, I'll be needing one of your larger tables this morning, since your smaller tables simply cannot accommodate the sheer size of my massive trophy.",
        "LUKE: Put it on the floor.",
        "KIRK: It needs its own chair.",
        "LUKE: It's gonna need some glue if you don't sit down pretty soon.",
        "KIRK: Everybody hates a winner.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, how \u0091bout one person gets pancakes and one person gets eggs and then we can share?",
        "RORY: I can't, I have to go.",
        "LORELAI: What are you talking about? It's \u0096",
        "[Rory shows Lorelai her watch]",
        "LORELAI: [gasps] It took us thirty minutes to get here?",
        "RORY: Lots of limping.",
        "LORELAI: Wow, shoot. Well, at least grab a donut before you go. Hey, unh, Luke, uh, we need a couple of donuts, and, uh, some of those extra legs Heather Mills is sending over to Croatia.",
        "LUKE: Coming right up.",
        "[Jess walks down from upstairs]",
        "JESS: Hi.",
        "RORY: Hey.",
        "JESS: Hi.",
        "LORELAI: Hi.",
        "JESS: Hi.",
        "LUKE: Hi.",
        "RORY: I have to get to school.",
        "JESS: Yeah, me too.",
        "RORY: Bye",
        "JESS: Bye. Bye.",
        "LORELAI: Bye.",
        "RORY: Bye.",
        "LORELAI: Bye.",
        "RORY: Bye.",
        "LUKE: Bye.",
        "[Rory leaves. Jess goes back upstairs]",
        "LUKE: What the hell was that?",
        "LORELAI: That was episode one of Rory and Jess: The Early Years.",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: Rory and Jess are together.",
        "LUKE: Are you serious? What about Dean?",
        "LORELAI: Dean and Rory broke up at the dance.",
        "LUKE: They did? I was at the dance, how come I didn't know about this?",
        "LORELAI: Because you're you.",
        "LUKE: But why, what happened?",
        "LORELAI: Jess happened.",
        "LUKE: Wow, wow. So. . .",
        "LORELAI: Yup.",
        "LUKE: Wow. Well, this is great.",
        "LORELAI: I'll tell Dean you said that.",
        "LUKE: You know what I mean, Rory and Jess, Jess and Rory. I think this is great. Don't you think this is great?",
        "LORELAI: I think Rory's seventeen and it's probably about time for a Jess.",
        "LUKE: Look, I know Jess is a little tough sometimes, but he likes Rory and Rory's a good kid, hopefully she'll rub off on him.",
        "LORELAI: You know what, I've spent a lot of time and energy fighting the whole Jess thing. Rory's made her choice, I want her to be happy. I'm just hoping for the best at this point.",
        "LUKE: Very romantic.",
        "LORELAI: Says the man who yelled \"Finally!\" at the end of Love Story.",
        "LUKE: I'll get you coffee.",
        "LORELAI: Thank you very much.",
        "CUT TO THE ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE",
        "[Lorelai, Rory, and Richard are sitting at the table. Emily is standing at the doorway to the kitchen]",
        "EMILY: Do it again, please! [walks to her seat at the table] I'm not quite sure what other way there is to say \u0091no walnuts in the salad' except to say \u0091no walnuts in the salad.'",
        "LORELAI: Mom, she just made a mistake.",
        "EMILY: She doesn't listen, she doesn't care, she has no work ethic.",
        "LORELAI: She has some work ethic. You made her remake the salad four times.",
        "EMILY: I like things done correctly.",
        "RICHARD: Preferably the first time.",
        "EMILY: Thank you, Richard.",
        "LORELAI: You know, Mom, in Europe, they eat the salad last and the main course first.",
        "EMILY: We're not in Europe.",
        "LORELAI: We could pretend.",
        "EMILY: Really, Lorelai, you can't wait ten minutes for another salad? The situation's that dire?",
        "LORELAI: Four salads ago, no, not dire. Right now it's \u0091your money for nothing and your chicks for free.'",
        "EMILY: Rory?",
        "RORY: She didn't have lunch.",
        "EMILY: Fine.",
        "RICHARD: Where are you going?",
        "EMILY: Apparently, we're going to be European tonight.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, wonderful. I was getting so tired of being American day after day after day.",
        "LORELAI: God, I'm starved.",
        "RORY: Think about something else.",
        "LORELAI: Like what?",
        "RORY: Something disgusting that will take your appetite away.",
        "LORELAI: Ari Fleischer?",
        "RICHARD: Ari Fleischer is our nation's mouthpiece, young lady.",
        "LORELAI: Officially not hungry now.",
        "EMILY: Liliana will be right out with the sand dabs. I'm afraid we're going to have to let her go, Richard.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, if that's how you feel, Emily.",
        "LORELAI: You're firing someone over putting walnuts in a salad?",
        "EMILY: I'm going to fire someone over putting walnuts in the salad after she was told not to put walnuts in the salad.",
        "LORELAI: Mom, you know, if you're not a little nicer to your help, you might find yourself in a Frank Lloyd Wright situation.",
        "RICHARD: Frank Lloyd Wright?",
        "EMILY: What on earth does Frank Lloyd Wright have to do with my salad?",
        "RICHARD: And your walnuts.",
        "LORELAI: Mrs. Wright apparently had this major problem with her help. She was very rough on them and they totally hated her. So this guy who had worked for her forever, he had finally had enough. I believe the incident was over walnuts, wasn't it, honey?",
        "RORY: The exact cause has not been proven.",
        "LORELAI: Anyhow, Mrs. Wright invites this whole posse of people over for dinner and they're all sitting around eating, and Mr. Disgruntled Servant Guy goes outside and locks all the doors and windows and douses the whole house in gasoline and sets the place on fire.",
        "EMILY: My goodness.",
        "LORELAI: So the house is on fire, and people are freaking out, so they run to the doors but the doors are locked, so a few of them try to get out through the windows, but Mr. Angry-Puss is standing outside with an ax hacking them to death and so they all died.",
        "EMILY: Why on earth would you tell me that story?",
        "LORELAI: All I'm saying is sometimes eating a walnut is preferable to getting hacked to death or set on fire during dinner.",
        "EMILY: One of these days I'm going to make you eat in your room.",
        "RORY: I'm going to go get myself another soda. Would anyone else like something?",
        "LORELAI: I'd like a big bag of walnuts, and make sure you tell her they're for me.",
        "RICHARD: I believe I need a little more ice. Emily, are you fine?",
        "EMILY: Yes, Richard, I'm fine, thank you.",
        "[Lorelai sniffs the air]",
        "EMILY: Oh, stop that!",
        "CUT TO THE KITCHEN",
        "[Rory pulls a soda out of the fridge as Richard walks in]",
        "RICHARD: Did you find it?",
        "RORY: Yes, I did.",
        "RICHARD: Good, good. Ah, here we are, ice. And. . .chocolates.",
        "RORY: Bless you.",
        "RICHARD: So, tell me, how's it going at school?",
        "RORY: It's good. It's crazy.",
        "RICHARD: Senior year.",
        "RORY: Yup.",
        "RICHARD: Preparing for college can be a daunting task. I remember when I was preparing for Yale.",
        "RORY: Bad?",
        "RICHARD: I don't believe I slept the entire year. I didn't even cut my hair for two months.",
        "RORY: Grandpa!",
        "RICHARD: Oh, yes, it was quite a scandal. But in the end, it was all worth it.",
        "RORY: Yeah?",
        "RICHARD: My years at Yale were absolutely the most gratifying ones of my life. Just the sheer freedom of knowing that anything I wanted to learn, I could learn right there. Plus, the history of the place, the heritage. . .my father went to Yale.",
        "RORY: I know.",
        "RICHARD: I also made wonderful friends there. Friends I still have today.",
        "RORY: That must be nice.",
        "RICHARD: I'm going to be going back there next week. There's going to be a little reunion of the Whiffenpoofs.",
        "RORY: I'm sorry, the what?",
        "RICHARD: It's an a cappella singing group I belonged to at Yale.",
        "RORY: A singing group?",
        "RICHARD: A very famous singing group, actually. Like the Beatles, but with better table manners.",
        "RORY: I've never heard you sing.",
        "RICHARD: Well, I'm no Perry Como, but my shower hasn't kicked me out yet. Anyway, a group of us are going to get together at the old alma mater and have a little dinner, swap some war stories.",
        "RORY: Sounds fun.",
        "[the maid walks by with a tray]",
        "MAID: Excuse me.",
        "RORY: Uh, did you see what I just saw?",
        "RICHARD: Walnuts.",
        "RORY: Poor Grandma.",
        "RICHARD: Poor us. You know, you might wanna come with me next week.",
        "RORY: Come with you where?",
        "RICHARD: To Yale.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "RICHARD: Oh, I don't mean to the dinner, that would be boring for you, but you might enjoy seeing the school.",
        "RORY: Well \u0096",
        "RICHARD: Your mother could come to. It would be a fun little adventure.",
        "RORY: Wow.",
        "RICHARD: We could drive down, have a little roadside snack, get there about noon. Have a little tour, and then the two of you girls could go off and have fun, and the old folks can have a somber little dinner. I think you'd love to see it. I certainly would love to show it to you.",
        "RORY: Well. . .sure, Grandpa. That would be nice.",
        "RICHARD: Wonderful. Oh, I'm thrilled. Uh, do you wanna tell your mother or shall I?",
        "RORY: Oh, you know what, I can tell her.",
        "RICHARD: All right, you tell her. [the maid rushes past them again] Looks like we're gonna need a few more of these.",
        "RORY: Yeah.",
        "CUT TO OUTSIDE THE ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE",
        "[Lorelai and Rory walk out of the house]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, I officially vote that we send my mother an anonymous note requesting that she never make us the sand dabs again.",
        "RORY: I'm not sure how anonymous it would be considering she said we were the first people she ever made them for.",
        "[they get into the car and Lorelai starts the engine]",
        "RORY: I have to tell you something.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "RORY: Grandpa talked to me tonight.",
        "[Lorelai turns off the engine]",
        "RORY: Why'd you turn the car off?",
        "LORELAI: I'm just getting the sense that I shouldn't be driving a large vehicle when you tell me this.",
        "RORY: It's no big deal.",
        "LORELAI: Uh huh.",
        "RORY: It's not.",
        "LORELAI: Then tell me.",
        "RORY: Okay. Um, well, Grandpa was mentioning that he and Grandma are going on a trip next week, a driving trip somewhere, and he invited me to go. And you. He invited you and me to go on a trip with him and Grandma.",
        "LORELAI: Where?",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Where's the driving trip to?",
        "RORY: Yale.",
        "[Lorelai gets out of the car and walks toward the porch. Rory follows her]",
        "RORY: Mom? Mom, wait.",
        "LORELAI: No, it's okay, I got it.",
        "RORY: He's going for some nostalgia thing. For a reunion of, I don't know, the Whiffenhoofs.",
        "LORELAI: Poofs.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Whiffenpoofs.",
        "RORY: Not much better.",
        "LORELAI: I totally agree.",
        "RORY: Well, he got all sentimental and he really just wants to show me the campus. It's no big deal.",
        "LORELAI: It's a huge deal.",
        "RORY: Mom.",
        "LORELAI: There's a reason he wants to drag you out there, Rory. He's manipulating you. Trust me, I know, he's a master at it.",
        "RORY: Okay, fine, maybe he is, but he really wants me to go, I can tell. And you don't have to go. I mean, he invited you and I would really love it if you could come, but really, you can stay home. Just please don't make a big thing out of this. This doesn't have to be a fight.",
        "LORELAI: Rory.",
        "RORY: We go. We look. Hi Yale. Bye Yale. It's over. No harm, no foul.",
        "LORELAI: How many more two-word sentences can you come up with?",
        "RORY: You know, it doesn't have to be a total loss.",
        "LORELAI: Look, as she's leading me back to the car.",
        "RORY: I'm sure you and I can figure out a fun thing to do while they're off at dinner, some cool road trip thing.",
        "LORELAI: In New Haven?",
        "RORY: Well, yeah.",
        "LORELAI: Sweetie, have you ever been to New Haven?",
        "RORY: No.",
        "LORELAI: Take a look at the coffee pot tomorrow before I clean it, that's New Haven.",
        "RORY: We can make it fun. It would mean a lot to the grandparents, everybody wins.",
        "LORELAI: Rory, listen to me.",
        "RORY: I know, I am being manipulated. This is part of Grandpa's evil plan to take over my life, abolish my free will, pull me in into the Gilmore world, dress me in pearls, and ruin my life. Did I leave anything out?",
        "LORELAI: Mm, let me see. . . manipulate, evil plan, no free will, pearls \u0096 no, I think you about covered it. Oh, wait \u0096 did you call my father the Puppet Master?",
        "RORY: No, I did not.",
        "LORELAI: Always call him the Puppet Master.",
        "RORY: I will never make that mistake again.",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Luke is cleaning off a table as Kirk walks in]",
        "KIRK: Luke, where's your lost and found?",
        "LUKE: Out back in the dumpster.",
        "KIRK: I need your help. I don't know what to do. I'm shaking like a spastic colon.",
        "LUKE: What's the matter, Kirk?",
        "KIRK: My trophy's gone.",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "KIRK: Someone took her.",
        "LUKE: Kirk.",
        "KIRK: The last time I remember seeing her, she was next to me at the movies.",
        "LUKE: Stop calling it she.",
        "KIRK: I retraced my steps all day and nothing. I suspect foul play.",
        "LUKE: Foul play?",
        "KIRK: Kidnapping, possibly.",
        "LUKE: Well, then, I think you should go to the police, and if they mention something about staying somewhere for observation, it's just routine.",
        "[Kirk starts to leave as Rory walks in]",
        "RORY: Hey Kirk.",
        "KIRK: Rory. [looks into her backpack]",
        "RORY: What are you doing?",
        "KIRK: Where were you this morning at about ten?",
        "RORY: At school.",
        "KIRK: Do you have any witnesses?",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "KIRK: Can you get them to make a short statement?",
        "RORY: No.",
        "KIRK: Oh, well, okay. [leaves]",
        "RORY: Someone took his statue again.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, yeah.",
        "RORY: Every year.",
        "LUKE: Well, there's some things in life that never let you down. So. . .",
        "RORY: So. . .",
        "LUKE: It's nice to see you, Rory.",
        "RORY: It's nice to see you, too, Luke.",
        "LUKE: So, table for one?",
        "RORY: Um, I'll just sit at the counter.",
        "LUKE: Okay. What can I get you?",
        "RORY: Um, I guess I'll have a cheeseburger.",
        "[Jess walks down from upstairs]",
        "LUKE: Hey Jess, look who's here \u0096 Rory.",
        "JESS: Hi.",
        "RORY: Hi.",
        "LUKE: Okay, time to add another word. Jess, you want something to eat?",
        "JESS: I'm not hungry.",
        "RORY: Oh, yeah, I'm not hungry either.",
        "LUKE: What about the burger?",
        "RORY: Oh, well. . .could you wrap it up? I'm gonna eat it later. I actually prefer burgers after they've been sitting around for awhile. Let's them age.",
        "LUKE: Okay.",
        "JESS: You know, I've got that book upstairs.",
        "RORY: Oh, the book we talked about?",
        "JESS: Yup.",
        "RORY: Great.",
        "JESS: We could go upstairs and look at it.",
        "RORY: Look at the book, sure. Let's go upstairs and look at the book.",

        "RICHARD: Oh, I told him that you weren't finished deciding, that you were being very picky. I think that made him want you even more. They can be very competitive, these Ivy League schools. He's expecting you at three. Oh, look, it's three now. Well, we timed this perfectly now, didn't we? Come on, I'll walk you in. Uh, we'll be right back.",

You want Rory to go to Harvard that badly? Well, so do thousands of other mothers. Yale is an excellent school, the equal of Harvard in every way except one \u0096 I went here. I'm an alumnus. That makes it easier for Rory to get in. And if you had any idea about the way the system works, you'd know this.",

        "RICHARD: I am not going to leave Rory's education to chance simply because I might risk offending you. Her future is more important than your pride. If you don't like that, I'm sorry. If it makes you angry, well, what else is new? But that, my dear girl, is the way it is.",

        "EMILY: So Rory takes a meeting at Yale. That doesn't mean she still won't go to Harvard.",
        "LORELAI: I know it doesn't, because she is still going to Harvard.",
        "EMILY: If she applies to Yale \u0096",
        "LORELAI: She's not applying to Yale!",
        "EMILY: And gets into Yale, that might even make her more appealing to Harvard. Have you thought about that?",

I try to figure out why we can't communicate and why we can't seem to break through whatever crap it is that stands between us, and then something like this happens and suddenly it's like, \u0091Oh yeah. That's why.'",
        "EMILY: Fine, Lorelai, your father's a demon. He's cruel and out to destroy your happiness. But think about this \u0096 you're fighting so hard to send Rory off to Harvard no matter what that you haven't even stopped for one second to consider that if she went to Yale, she could live at home.
