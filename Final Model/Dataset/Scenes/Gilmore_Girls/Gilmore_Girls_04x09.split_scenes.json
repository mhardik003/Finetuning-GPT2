        "OPEN ON THE SIDEWALK",
        "[Lorelai and Rory are walking toward Luke's Diner]",
        "LORELAI: \"Twenty-three is old. It's almost twenty-five, which is, like, almost mid-twenties.\"",
        "RORY: She did not say that.",
        "LORELAI: She did say that.",
        "RORY: It seems a little wrong that Jessica Simpson is alive and well and Roy got eaten by his tiger.",
        "LORELAI: Aw. Survival of the fittest, baby.",
        "[They walk into the diner]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, man, this place is packed.",
        "RORY: Damn that Zagat guide.",
        "LORELAI: Only the loser mini-table is open.",
        "RORY: What do we do?",
        "LORELAI: Time to hover. You take the old couple, I'll hit the cybergeek.",
        "RORY: Got it. [walks over to an older couple eating] Hello.",
        "LORELAI: [walks over to a guy working on a laptop] Hello.",
        "[A few minutes later, they slide two tables together and sit down]",
        "LORELAI: That was some of the best hovering I've ever seen you do.",
        "RORY: I was taught by the best.",
        "LORELAI: But the focus - you never blinked. And the sneeze - so tiny, so dainty, so terrifying to the old.",
        "RORY: Luke's gonna be mad. I mean, he hates it when we commandeer two tables during rush hour.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, he only hated it that one time.",
        "RORY: What time?",
        "LORELAI: The time when we did it and he was mad.",
        "RORY: He's hated it every time we've done it.",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "RORY: Yeah.",
        "LORELAI: No, only the one time.",
        "RORY: Which time?",
        "LORELAI: The time we did it and he was mad.",
        "RORY: You're gonna do this to Luke, aren't you?",
        "LORELAI: 'Til he's so dizzy he throws up.",
        "RORY: Nice. Calendars?",
        "LORELAI: Let's do it. Okay, so, uh, your finals-induced hibernation period is setting in. . .",
        "RORY: Monday.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. So how about, uh, Sunday we have a major Sephora fix, maybe a movie - sort of a see-ya day before you go bye-bye?",
        "RORY: Throw in a pedicure and you got a deal.",
        "LORELAI: Done.",
        "[Luke walks over]",
        "LUKE: Hey. Coffee's gonna be ready in a sec. You know what you want?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, um, well, we need napkins to cover this big, wide, expansive table.",
        "LUKE: Okay. Uh, hey, are you in the mood for pancakes?",
        "LORELAI: Pancakes, sure, yeah. I guess we have enough space for pancakes.",
        "LUKE: 'Cause I'm making pumpkin pancakes and it comes with homemade cinnamon butter.",
        "RORY: You made cinnamon butter?",
        "LUKE: This morning.",
        "LORELAI: Wow. I bet the other people who would love a table right now but can't have one 'cause they're all taken would love pumpkin pancakes with homemade cinnamon butter.",
        "LUKE: I'll get your coffee.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, hold on.",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: We're sitting at two tables.",
        "LUKE: Yeah?",
        "LORELAI: You hate that. That makes you mad.",
        "LUKE: Only the one time.",
        "LORELAI: Why are you so sunny this morning?",
        "LUKE: Well, actually, I finally hired some help.",
        "RORY: Oh, good for you.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, I figured I needed the help. What the hell, get a kid in here to pick up the slack, ya know? I kind of feel like a weight's been lifted, ya know?",
        "LORELAI: Sounds very sensible.",
        "LUKE: Let me get your food going. [walks away]",
        "RORY: Okay, so, talk to me.",
        "LORELAI: Talk to you about what?",
        "RORY: Talk to me about Jason.",
        "LORELAI: There's nothing to talk about.",
        "RORY: Oh, come on. I'm in a serious romantic dry spell. I need to live vicariously through somebody.",
        "LORELAI: He has called.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: He has sent things.",
        "RORY: Pipe bombs?",
        "LORELAI: Flowers, candy.",
        "RORY: Even better.",
        "LORELAI: But I don't know, he's my father's partner, I've known him forever. I mean, can you imagine if I actually went out with someone from my 'hood?",
        "RORY: Do you like him?",
        "LORELAI: Well, he's completely not my type, but he does have a thing and the smarts and he does keep up.",
        "RORY: Maybe you should just go out with him and see what happens.",
        "LORELAI: No. Dad would flip and Mom hates him, so she would see it as some sort of personal attack and I'm just getting her off me for spilling wine on the carpet.",
        "RORY: When did you do that?",
        "LORELAI: Ninth grade.",
        "RORY: Huh.",
        "LORELAI: Things are quiet now. I just wanna keep them quiet.",
        "[A bell dings]",
        "LUKE: [calls] Hey, Brennon, pick up.",
        "RORY: Oh, my God.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RORY: He hired Brennon Lewis.",
        "LORELAI: You know him?",
        "RORY: I went to junior high with him.",
        "LORELAI: And?",
        "RORY: Ew!",
        "LORELAI: He doesn't look that bad.",
        "RORY: He's the boy who dissected a frog, did not wash his hands, and then ate a sandwich.",
        "LORELAI: Ew!",
        "RORY: He's like the lost Farrelly brother. He's so stupid. He watched \"The Breakfast Club\" and decided to tape his own butt cheeks together.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, so Mensa's not sending him a t-shirt yet, but Luke has hired him so we have to give him a chance.",
        "[Brennon brings their plates to the table]",
        "BRENNON: You have the pancakes?",
        "LORELAI: We sure do.",
        "RORY: Hi, Brennon.",
        "BRENNON: Hey.",
        "RORY: Rory Gilmore. Um, we went to school together.",
        "BRENNON: Yeah?",
        "RORY: You don't remember. Biology - the frog?",
        "BRENNON: There have been a lot of frogs, man.",
        "RORY: Okay. Thanks for the food.",
        "BRENNON: Yep. [walks away]",
        "LORELAI: Your kids will be gorgeous.",
        "[opening credits]",
        "CUT TO YALE CAFETERIA",
        "[Rory, Paris, and Richard are eating at a table]",
        "RICHARD: This roommate of mine in sophomore year - we absolutely hated him. He was, in addition to being a complete nincompoop, rather a chubby lad. So one night, we tied him in between two mattresses and threw him out the window.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "PARIS: I'm writing that one down.",
        "RORY: Was he okay?",
        "RICHARD: Oh, he was fine. He went to sleep. He woke up in the morning and picked up right where he left off.",
        "RORY: Man.",
        "RICHARD: We wound up throwing him out the window every night for a month, and then he transferred.",
        "RORY: Well, do you think you guys tossing him out the window on a regular basis had something to do with that decision?",
        "RICHARD: Well, it crossed our minds, yes. However, we were young and full of energy. Every day was an adventure. No challenge was too great. We wanted to change the world.",
        "PARIS: This is so great. Richard, I want to thank you for inviting me to lunch.",
        "RICHARD: Well, you're very welcome, Paris. How often does a man like me get the chance to entertain two such lovely and intelligent young ladies?",
        "PARIS: You are a honey-tongued devil, aren't you, Dick?",
        "RICHARD: So, tell me, what are your plans for the game?",
        "RORY: The what?",
        "RICHARD: The game. The Harvard-Yale game.",
        "PARIS: I'm going. I already have my ticket. I bought it a month ago.",
        "RORY: You did?",
        "PARIS: It's the game, Rory. It's a memory - a college memory, and I intend on having as many college memories as possible.",
        "RICHARD: Your grandmother and I have attended every one of these games for the past 32 years. We always buy a block of seats, and we got one for you. So how about it? We'd love to take you.",
        "RORY: And I would love to go.",
        "RICHARD: Good. It'll be a wonderful day.",
        "PARIS: It will be a day to remember.",
        "[A man stops at their table]",
        "ASHER: Richard?",
        "RICHARD: Asher! Oh, look at you!",
        "ASHER: Good to see you.",
        "RICHARD: Good to see you.",
        "PARIS: [quietly to Rory] Your grandfather knows Asher Fleming? That's amazing. I read his latest book four times. He was on Charlie Rose last week and he almost kept me awake.",
        "RORY: Well, I didn't know he knew him.",
        "PARIS: I wonder if I can get an interview with him for the paper.",
        "RORY: What if I want an interview with him for the paper?",
        "PARIS: What?",
        "RORY: Well, he's my grandfather.",
        "PARIS: You're stealing my interview.",
        "RORY: No, I'm just making you crazy.",
        "PARIS: Like that's hard. Feel proud.",
        "RICHARD: Girls, I'd like to introduce you to a former classmate of mine - Asher Fleming. Asher, this is my granddaughter, Rory.",
        "RORY: Hello.",
        "ASHER: A pleasure to meet you.",
        "RICHARD: And her friend, Paris Geller.",
        "ASHER: Paris.",
        "PARIS: I saw you on Charlie Rose. You were good.",
        "ASHER: Thank you.",
        "PARIS: Not too self-important, you made your point, and managed to look remotely interested when Charlie babbled on pretentiously about nothing.",
        "ASHER: Well, Charlie Rose is a good friend of mine.",
        "PARIS: Whatever. Listen, professor, I'd love to do a profile on you for the paper. Nothing puffy. Straight-up, hard-hitting, uncensored. Your views, no slant. Tomorrow work for you?",
        "ASHER: Well, I'll, uh, have to check my schedule. I do teach, you know.",
        "PARIS: Sure, you gotta pay the bills.",
        "ASHER: Richard, terrific to see you again. Let's have lunch next week.",
        "RICHARD: Consider it a date.",
        "ASHER: Splendid.",
        "RICHARD: Right.",
        "ASHER: Goodbye, ladies. [walks away]",
        "PARIS: I'm a fan! I could've opened with that, couldn't I have?",
        "RORY: Then you wouldn't be you.",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai walks in and checks the answering machine]",
        "JASON: [on answering machine] Okay, see, a better man, a smarter man, a different man, would take into account the fact that flowers, candy, and numerous phone calls have gone completely unnoticed by you. Those men would get a clue, have some pride, grow a pair, and move on. Oh, well. Lorelai Gilmore, daughter of Richard and Emily, mother of Rory, and friend to all, would you join me for dinner on Saturday night? Please call me back because I will someday find my pathetic threshold and stop trying.",
        "[Lorelai picks up the phone and calls Jason]",
        "JASON: This is Jason.",
        "LORELAI: This is Lorelai.",
        "JASON: You're kidding.",
        "LORELAI: No, I'm not.",
        "JASON: You're really calling me back?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I am.",
        "JASON: Is there someone there who could document this - a photographer or a really fast painter?",
        "LORELAI: See, you get the girl to call you back and then you give her a hard time.",
        "JASON: You're right, I apologize. So, how are you?",
        "LORELAI: I'm fine, and you?",
        "JASON: Uh, I don't know. I've got a slight suspicion you've called to tell me you're not available for dinner on Saturday night, and that's gonna bum me out.",
        "LORELAI: Look, Jason -",
        "JASON: Okay, before you continue, just let me say that I got us reservations at the China Garden.",
        "LORELAI: Ah, you're kidding.",
        "JASON: Very hot ticket in town. Good food, great bar, quite a scene.",
        "LORELAI: How did you do that?",
        "JASON: Pulled a few strings, greased a few palms, sold myself to a sous-chef - a very tender man, I might add.",
        "LORELAI: I just want you to be happy.",
        "JASON: So, long story short - table for two at 8:30. You need a little black dress.",
        "LORELAI: I am so incredibly tempted.",
        "JASON: But?",
        "LORELAI: But you work with my father. You're hated by my mother. You come from my world.",
        "JASON: You find me repulsive.",
        "LORELAI: No, I don't, and I wish I did.",
        "JASON: Okay, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna keep the reservation and go by myself. I've been reading about this place for months, and personally, I would like to see what all the fuss is about.",
        "LORELAI: Do you understand at all where I'm coming from?",
        "JASON: Nope, but that's okay.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I'm sorry, Jason.",
        "JASON: Me, too. I bet you look good in one of those little black dresses.",
        "LORELAI: Well, yes, I do.",
        "JASON: Goodbye, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Bye, Jason.",
        "CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE",
        "[Lorelai, Rory, Emily, and Richard are eating dinner]",
        "EMILY: It's ten o'clock at night and suddenly I hear this terrible racket. So I go outside and there is May Richmond sneaking a 6-foot Rudolph into her garage.",
        "RICHARD: That woman is working my last nerve.",
        "LORELAI: So what?",
        "RICHARD: So what? Don't you know what this means?",
        "LORELAI: I'm racking my brain.",
        "EMILY: They're going to put a giant plastic reindeer on their roof.",
        "RICHARD: Which is right next to our roof.",
        "LORELAI: So, what, are you scared they'll keep you up all night playing reindeer games?",
        "RICHARD: They can't light them up. The homeowners association has very strict rules about the amount of lights that you can display in front of your house, and they already have those lawn twinklers.",
        "EMILY: They could give up their lawn twinklers and focus solely on the reindeer.",
        "RICHARD: I don't know. They were awfully proud of their twinklers last year. It was all they talked about.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, guys - take a step back, examine the conversation you're having, and spend some time apart.",
        "RORY: May I have some more roast, please, Grandma?",
        "EMILY: Of course you may.",
        "LORELAI: It's really good tonight, Mom.",
        "EMILY: Thank you, Lorelai.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, by the way, Rory, we will pick you up in front of your residence hall tomorrow morning, nine o'clock sharp.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: Tomorrow? What's happening tomorrow?",
        "EMILY: Tomorrow's the game.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, the game. . .",
        "RICHARD: The game. The Harvard-Yale game.",
        "LORELAI: Right, right. Football?",
        "EMILY: Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Why does the question \"Football?\" get a \"Lorelai\"?",
        "RICHARD: Yes, it's football - the most important football game of the entire year. All of Yale will be there.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, cool. Can I go?",
        "RICHARD: You want to go to a football game?",
        "LORELAI: Well, if it's such a big deal, absolutely.",
        "EMILY: But you don't like football.",
        "LORELAI: Well, no, I'm not the diehard fan that, say, you are, Mom, but it's Rory's school.",
        "RICHARD: You won't get bored?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, of course I'll get bored, but that's when the \"South Park\" impressions kick in.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai, we have invited friends - important people.",
        "LORELAI: I'm kidding, Mom. I can only do Cartman.",
        "RICHARD: So, you want to go?",
        "LORELAI: Yup.",
        "EMILY: You're sure about this?",
        "LORELAI: Absolutely positive.",
        "RICHARD: Well, I guess we could uninvite someone.",
        "EMILY: Cecil, perhaps.",
        "RICHARD: Or Donlon.",
        "EMILY: Donlon just had his colon removed.",
        "RICHARD: Well, Cecil then. I guess I should call him now, give him time to get another ticket.",
        "EMILY: I'll call his wife.",
        "LORELAI: Thanks.",
        "[Emily and Richard leave the room]",
        "RORY: What is wrong with you?",
        "LORELAI: What is wrong with you? Why didn't you get me a ticket to the game?",
        "RORY: I was saving you, dummy.",
        "LORELAI: Saving me from what?",
        "RORY: You hate football.",
        "LORELAI: So do you.",
        "RORY: Yeah, I know I hate football, but I couldn't get out of it. You could.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, so I have to go watch a football game. At least I get to hang with you before finals.",
        "RORY: You sure?",
        "LORELAI: Of course. I mean, what's a football game last? Hour, hour and a half? Longer than an hour and a half? Are you kidding me?",
        "RICHARD: Damn it. Emily, Cecil's the one who had his colon removed. I'm calling Donlon.",
        "LORELAI: Ugh.",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table]",
        "LORELAI: I hate football.",
        "RORY: I tried to get you out of it.",
        "LORELAI: Well, you should have tried harder.",
        "RORY: Next time. Where's Luke?",
        "LORELAI: Probably in bed where the rest of the world is on a Saturday. Did I put on underwear?",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: I think I forgot to put on underwear. Can you check? [pause] Did I just ask you to check if I put on underwear?",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: I hate football.",
        "RORY: You just need coffee.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Froggy.",
        "RORY: Brennon?",
        "LORELAI: I hate that kid.",
        "RORY: I thought we were gonna give him a chance.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, chance ended when he dumped a chili-bean omelet on me the other day.",
        "RORY: What do we do? Oh, he's coming over.",
        "[Brennon walks over]",
        "BRENNON: What can I do for you, chicas?",
        "RORY: Oh, we'd just like to order, please.",
        "BRENNON: Go ahead.",
        "LORELAI: I'll have the cheese omelet, extra cheddar, no Jack, sourdough toast, two bacons, two sausages. . .you're not writing this down.",
        "BRENNON: Don't need to. Continue.",
        "LORELAI: Two bacons, two sausages, one pancake. . .I would really like you to write this down.",
        "BRENNON: Trust me, it's all stored. What would you like?",
        "RORY: Rye toast.",
        "BRENNON: You want that toasted?",
        "RORY: Sure, why not?",
        "BRENNON: Got it. [leaves]",
        "LORELAI: Rye toast?",
        "RORY: My odds are way better than yours.",
        "LANE: Brennon!",
        "BRENNON: Oh, nice volume.",
        "LANE: This is a box of doughnuts.",
        "BRENNON: Yeah?",
        "LANE: It's supposed to be a box of bagels.",
        "BRENNON: What, they both have holes in them, right?",
        "LANE: We've already had this conversation. Get me the bagels, get me the bagels! Go. Now. Bye.",
        "KIRK: Excuse me, can I get a napkin?",
        "BRENNON: Yeah, sure. [pulls one from his pocket and drops it on the table]",
        "KIRK: Excuse me, can I get a napkin to put my napkin on?",
        "LANE: You know, this is so completely unfair. I didn't even know Luke was looking for someone. I would love to work here.",
        "RORY: Your mother would have let you?",
        "LORELAI: I mean, Luke is a man. With man parts, we think.",
        "LANE: Luke's is one of the few Mrs. Kim-approved places. No alcohol, walking distance to the church, and you can see my house from here. I totally need the money, and instead I get to return a box of doughnuts once a day.",
        "[Brennon brings a plate to the table]",
        "BRENNON: Rye toast.",
        "RORY: Told ya.",
        "BRENNON: You wanted, uh, something, right?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, excuse me just a second, won't you?",
        "BRENNON: Sure.",
        "[Lorelai walks over to Luke at the counter]",
        "LORELAI: Luke?",
        "LUKE: What are you doing here?",
        "LORELAI: Uh, we're going to the Harvard-Yale game.",
        "LUKE: You're going to the Harvard-Yale game? You know what they do at the Harvard-Yale game?",
        "LORELAI: They make babies?",
        "LUKE: They play football.",

        "RICHARD: I and a group of like-minded young men decided to protest the new dress code by wearing silk ties and nothing else. We were written up by the dean of admissions and threatened with expulsion. We were also suddenly very popular with the ladies.",
        "EMILY: Ah, yes. This is exactly the kind of conversation I had hoped we would have with our granddaughter and her friend.",
        "RICHARD: One night in the hallway does not a true naked guy make, my friend.",
        "EMILY: Would you like to eat with us, Marty?",
        "MARTY: Oh, I would love to. It looks amazing. But I have to go. There's kind of a party going on over on the lawn, and I actually came by to see if Rory wanted to stop by for a little while.",
        "RORY: Oh, I can't.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, nonsense, of course you can go. Go visit your friends. I insist.",

        "EMILY: Once a year - that's when we talk to her. Once a year, right here at the game. We say hello, we ask about her health, we ask about her children, and if Stephen's not here, we ask about him. How did she know?",

        "RICHARD: You don't know it.",
        "EMILY: Why don't I know it?",
        "RICHARD: Because you've never been there.",
        "EMILY: How do you know I've never been there? You don't know everything about me. I don't know everything about you. I didn't know you were having lunch with Pennilyn Lott. We obviously don't know everything about each other. What restaurant?",

        "EMILY: I've never been there.",
        "RICHARD: We just had lunch and talked. Two old friends.",
        "EMILY: How nice. So, after all of these years of not having lunch and not talking, you two decide to get together and catch up. Whose idea was it?",
        "RICHARD: Emily, could we discuss this in the trailer?",
        "EMILY: We will discuss this right here. Whose idea was it?",
        "RICHARD: I don't know. We've been having lunch once a year for many years. It's just a little tradition.",
        "EMILY: Every year since when?",
        "RICHARD: Every year since we got married. Emily, please don't make this more dramatic than it has to be.",
        "EMILY: No, I certainly wouldn't want to do that.",
        "RICHARD: Pennilyn and I are just friends. We just wanted to keep track of each other. That was it.",
        "EMILY: So, you've lied to me for the last 39 years.",
        "RICHARD: Well, she didn't tell Stephen. It was only lunch.",

        "EMILY: Well, then perhaps he shouldn't have lied to me for the last 39 years. That's a surefire way not to get me upset.",
        "LORELAI: That's true, but it was just lunch.",
        "EMILY: It was lunch with Pennilyn Lott, Lorelai - the woman you insisted on talking to even though I told you not to.",
        "LORELAI: I didn't -",
        "EMILY: Your stubbornness is astounding to me. I asked you over and over to please refrain from talking to her.",
        "LORELAI: You asked me once, and -",
        "EMILY: But no, you had to push it, and now look what's happened! Are you happy?",
        "LORELAI: Are you seriously blaming me for this?",
        "EMILY: You had to talk to her!",
        "LORELAI: I didn't have lunch with her, Mom. Dad did.",
        "EMILY: I wouldn't have known! If you hadn't talked to her, I wouldn't have known, and everything would have been fine!",
        "LORELAI: So you'd rather just be in denial about things, Mom?",
        "EMILY: Everything would have been fine!",
        "LORELAI: But Dad still would have been having lunch with this woman once a year.",
        "EMILY: You weren't even supposed to come. It was supposed to be your father and me and Rory. You weren't supposed to come!",

        "LORELAI: Look how she seats us right away.",
        "JASON: You like that, huh?",
        "LORELAI: I do like that. Now, if she seats us next to Ted, we have to make sure to become his best friends so he invites us to all those famous newscaster parties.",

        "LORELAI: Red's good.",
        "JASON: Red it is.",

        "JASON: That's right.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, okay. Did they run out of tables or something?",
        "JASON: I requested this room.",
        "LORELAI: You requested it?",
        "JASON: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: You asked for it on purpose?",

        "LORELAI: Yes, we do, we have it. Lucky us. It's just that everything's kinda going on out there.",
        "JASON: So?",
        "LORELAI: Well, don't you wanna be out there with everybody else?",
        "JASON: Why?",

        "JASON: You know, all the people and the noise, you can't even hear yourself think.",
        "LORELAI: But that's the point of coming to a place like this.",
        "JASON: I thought the point of coming to a place like this would be to enjoy the food and the atmosphere.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, but all of the atmosphere is out there.",
        "JASON: You don't like the room.",
        "LORELAI: No, it's. . .it is weird, you know. I mean, the two of us sitting all alone in here. I feel like we're quarantined. It's like the ebola room or something.",
        "JASON: Okay, I don't know what to do.",
        "LORELAI: Why don't we ask for a table out there?",
        "JASON: Oh, no, the place is booked solid.",

        "LORELAI: Hi. Um, two tacos, an order of taquitos, a beef burrito with no onions, and, uh, don't bother bagging it, that'll just slow us down. Go ahead.",
