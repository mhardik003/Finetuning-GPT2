        "Still smarting from her split with Luke, Lorelai is further stung when she notices that Luke has moved his boat. Meanwhile, Luke volunteers to build the sets for a school production of \" Fiddler on the Roof \", knowing that Lorelai is doing costumes, in hopes that their paths will cross. Meanwhile, at Yale, Rory plans to reconnect with Marty to watch Marx Brothers movies, but Logan interrupts their day by inviting them to dinner with his group."

        "[Lorelai is walking around. A student hands her a flier.]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, sure. Thanks.",
        "[She continues walking. Busy students are everywhere. She knocks on Rory's dorm room door. A male voice answers.]",
        "VOICE: Come in.",
        "[Lorelai opens the door and sees Doyle on the couch.]",
        "LORELAI: Hi! Hello. I'm sorry, do I have the wrong room?",
        "DOYLE: I wouldn't know.",
        "PARIS [coming out of her room]: How delightful to have all of my towels used and then deposited in my hamper with my dry clothes to create a pungent musty combo. Hey, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Paris, good, I have the right room.",
        "PARIS: This is Rory's mother. LORELAI [leans over to shake Doyle's hand]: Hi. Lorelai.",
        "DOYLE: I'm Doyle, Rory's editor.",
        "PARIS: And my lover.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, well, super.",
        "DOYLE: I don't think lover is exactly the correct term, Paris.",
        "PARIS: Really? What is the correct term, Doyle?",
        "DOYLE: At a later time, Paris.",
        "PARIS: Doyle and I haven't defined the social aspects of our relationship yet.",
        "LORELAI: Ah.",
        "PARIS: Although we're having s*x three or four times a week, so apparently the sexual aspects of our relationship are crystal freaking clear.",
        "DOYLE: Paris, I beg you.",
        "LORELAI: Is Rory here? 'Cause I could wait outside, or -",
        "PARIS: I'm making you uncomfortable.",
        "DOYLE: Yes.",
        "PARIS: Her. Not you.",
        "LORELAI: No, I'm fine. You two should be alone.",
        "PARIS: I'm so sorry. I shouldn't be talking about love, or s*x, especially since you -",
        "LORELAI: Since I -",
        "PARIS: Don't have any.",
        "LORELAI: Rory! Are you here?",
        "RORY [OS]: Yeah, I'm just getting my coat!",
        "LORELAI: Ah! Can I watch?",
        "RORY [OS]: Oh, is Paris out there?",
        "LORELAI: She sure is.",
        "RORY [OS]: Come on in.",
        "LORELAI: Nice meeting you, Doyle.",
        "DOYLE: Nice to meet you, too.",
        "[Lorelai enters Rory's room. Doyle and Paris look at each other.]",
        "PARIS: Yes?",
        "DOYLE: You look so hot when you find me annoying.",
        "PARIS: Then I must be Gisele B\u00fcndchen to you 24/7.",
        "RORY'S ROOM",
        "[Rory is putting on lipstick. Lorelai waits near the door.]",
        "RORY: Sorry, I thought she and Doyle were indisposed.",
        "LORELAI: No, no, plenty of disposal going on. So I notice you told Paris about my breakup.",
        "RORY: Ah. I'm sorry, I didn't tell her on purpose. It's very difficult to keep anything from Paris. It's very close proximity and I swear she has a dog's ears.",
        "LORELAI: That's fine.",
        "RORY: I didn't mean to blab.",
        "LORELAI: I know. But, hey, don't worry about me. Things are starting to look up. [She holds up the flier she received outside.] They think I'm a student.",
        "RORY [peering at the flier]: And they also think you're Polynesian and potentially sexually undecided.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. Well, still an improvement.",
        "RORY: Okay. Ready.",
        "LORELAI: This was a good idea, having dinner.",
        "RORY: Well, it is Friday night.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, but Friday night dinner without Ava and Adolf. Lovely.",
        "RORY [indignant]: It's really not fair calling Grandpa Adolf!",
        "LORELAI: No, no, that was Grandma.",
        "RORY: Oh.",
        "[They enter the common room.]",
        "RORY: We're going.",
        "[Doyle is standing near the fridge eating out of a giant bag of chips.]",
        "DOYLE: Rory, are these your chips?",
        "RORY: Yes, Doyle.",
        "DOYLE [crunching]: Can I have some?",
        "RORY: Knock yourself out, Doyle.",
        "PARIS: Listen, Lorelai? If you decide that your breakup is something that you want to talk about, please let me know.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, Paris.",
        "PARIS: And let me know before Tuesday, because I'm doing a paper for my Emotional Mental Health class about how women of a certain age cope with loneliness, and I think you'd be a great lead-off antidote.",
        "[Lorelai, stunned, looks at Rory meaningfully.]",
        "RORY: You can't take her. She's trained in Krav Maga.",
        "LORELAI: Damn it.",

        "OPENING CREDITS",
        "YALE CAFETERIA",
        "[Lorelai and Rory are carrying trays of food, looking for a place to sit down.]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, so where do the cool kids sit?",
        "RORY: This is Yale. There are no cool tables.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, come on. Point out the cliques. The geeks. The stoners. The Plastics. Give me the scoop.",
        "RORY: The scoop is that this is Yale. There are no cliques, we are beyond cliques.",
        "LORELAI: So you get to college, and everybody just loves each other?",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: It's Haight Ashbury all over again.",
        "RORY: Except the tie-dye is done by Prada.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. [She starts to sit down at a table.]",
        "RORY: Hey, not that one.",
        "LORELAI: See, that was the clique table.",
        "RORY: No, it's under an air vent. [They sit at the next table.]",
        "LORELAI: Seriously, Grandma, buy a shawl.",
        "RORY: Hey, one good cold can set you back a month in studying.",
        "LORELAI: Mmm. See, in my mind, I heard 'partying', but okay.",
        "RORY [Raising her glass]: Here's to our very own special Friday night dinner.",
        "LORELAI: Hear, hear. [They clink their glasses.] This stuff looks pretty good.",
        "RORY: It is. So what's going on at home?",
        "LORELAI [gasps dramatically]: Big grapefruit shortage. The hurricanes wiped them out and Taylor is completely freaking out.",
        "RORY: I'm sure.",
        "LORELAI: And Patty and Babette are organizing Stars Hollow's first botox party.",
        "RORY: Are you invited?",
        "LORELAI: Are you insinuating I should be?",
        "RORY: So the Hollow's low on grapefruits.",
        "LORELAI: Uh-huh. And I'm doing costumes for the Stars Hollow Elementary School production of Fiddler on the Roof.",
        "RORY [meaningfully]: So, how are you doing?",
        "LORELAI: I'm doing fine.",
        "RORY: How are you doing?",
        "LORELAI: I'm doing fine. I swear. I'm getting better.",
        "RORY: No word from Luke?",
        "LORELAI [sighing]: Not waiting on word from Luke.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: Anyhow, I'm fine. I mean, not that I'm over it, but little by little it's getting easier to pretend it's easier, which means easier must be right around the corner.",
        "RORY: I'm sure it is.",
        "LORELAI: And I'm working on getting down a new routine. I've settled on Weston's in the morning.",
        "RORY: Decent coffee, excellent strudel.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. So, that's me. How are you?",
        "RORY: Hmm, well, I study, then study, then after a little study break, I study.",
        "LORELAI: Uh-huh. How's, um, Logan?",
        "RORY: He's been out of town for a while so I haven't seen him.",
        "LORELAI: Hmm. And what else?",
        "RORY: Mm. [Avoiding eye contact]",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RORY: I got an e-mail from Dad.",
        "LORELAI [surprised]: Oh, you did? Huh. When?",
        "RORY: Monday.",
        "LORELAI: Only two weeks after the fact. Very speedy.",
        "RORY: I'm sure he was just nervous.",
        "LORELAI: You know, you don't need to hide that from me.",
        "RORY: Well, I wasn't sure if you wanted to hear about it, or hear Dad's name -",
        "LORELAI: Hey, it's part of the whole 'moving on' thing, right? So what did he say?",
        "RORY: He wanted to give me his side of the story.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, well. Unless his side of the story includes having his long-lost evil twin lock him in the closet and come to the wedding in his place, his side of the story doesn't exist.",
        "RORY: He said it was all a misunderstanding.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RORY: He said the only reason he came was to celebrate Grandma and Grandpa's vow renewal.",
        "LORELAI: And 'cause Adolf told him to.",
        "RORY: He says he likes Luke.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, he's proven that.",
        "RORY: He just wants you to be happy.",
        "LORELAI: So, he got me dumped.",
        "RORY: And, basically that the whole thing was just a misunderstanding.",
        "LORELAI: You know, the more he defends himself, the more he needs to defend himself.",
        "RORY: Hey, do you think Grandpa knew about it?",
        "LORELAI: About Christopher coming?",
        "RORY: Do you think he planned it with Grandma?",
        "LORELAI: Look how panicked you are. No, honey, honestly, the whole thing reeks of Emily. I mean, not that I think he would have discouraged it, but I'm pretty sure she's the one who poisoned the apple and gave it to Dopey to bring to the party.",
        "RORY: Yeah.",
        "[Two girls sit down at their table. They look weak and shaken, and are holding their heads.]",
        "GIRL #1: Oh my God.",
        "GIRL #2: Never again.",
        "GIRL #1: Never, never again.",
        "LORELAI [quiet, to Rory]: See, we are at the cool table. [Rory looks at her.] I'm telling you, if she throws up you're golden.",
        "YALE COURTYARD",
        "[Lorelai and Rory are walking, eating ice cream.]",
        "LORELAI: You are so not starving here at Yale.",
        "RORY: My lips are frozen.",
        "LORELAI: Look, while it might seem a little eccentric to eat ice cream in forty degree weather -",
        "RORY: You'd think!",
        "LORELAI: There are several advantages to the concept. For example, since it's cold out, the ice cream won't melt, therefore it'll last longer.",
        "RORY: So then my lips will stay frozen for double the amount of time.",
        "LORELAI: Mm-hmm. Okay, I lost the feeling in my tongue!",
        "RORY: I'm throwing the ice cream out now.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, my God, it's frozen. It's like an ice cube. A tongue-shaped ice cube and it'll never thaw.",
        "RORY: Then why don't you shut your mouth? Let the heat stay inside?",
        "LORELAI: That was hostile. [Pause.] And useful. Thank you. [Points across the quad.] Hey, isn't that your naked guy?",
        "RORY: Oh, yeah. Marty, hey! He's not my naked guy.",
        "[Marty sees Rory, and as her attention is turned to Lorelai he runs in the other direction.]",
        "LORELAI: Well, you don't really want a communal naked guy, nowadays, you know, it's too sketchy. [They look over. Marty is gone.] Huh. Well, I guess he didn't hear about you sitting at the cool table.",
        "RORY [distracted]: Yeah.",
        "LORELAI: You guys rumbling?",
        "RORY: No, we're just not as close lately.",
        "LORELAI: Aw, that's too bad. He seems like a nice guy.",
        "RORY: Yeah, he is.",
        "LORELAI: All right, honey. Thank you for dinner.",
        "RORY: You're leaving?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, I should get back.",
        "RORY: Okay. You can come in and watch T.V. for a while if you want.",
        "LORELAI: It's okay.",
        "RORY: You can even stay over if you don't feel like driving back.",
        "LORELAI: Are there monsters under your bed again?",
        "RORY: I'm just saying.",
        "LORELAI: Look, Miss Nightingale. I appreciate your concern. And the offer to spend the night is much nicer than the suggestion that I shut my mouth, but I'm fine.",
        "RORY: You sure?",
        "LORELAI: Big girl.",
        "RORY: Yeah. It's still new.",
        "LORELAI: Angel, I have been dumped before.",
        "RORY: Not by Luke.",
        "LORELAI: No, not by Luke. But a dump is a dump. The process is still the same. Don't worry, Mom's cool.",
        "RORY: I know Mom's cool.",
        "LORELAI: 'Cause you heard about the table?",
        "RORY: Exactly.",
        "LORELAI: All right, kid, I'll see you later.",
        "RORY: Okay, bye. [They kiss on the cheek and Lorelai goes.]",
        "WESTON BAKERY",
        "[A couple carries their order toward the door.]",
        "LORELAI: Wow, looks good. Hey, I'm Lorelai, I'll be here every morning.",
        "[They leave.] 'Kay, see you guys tomorrow.",
        "WOMAN: Here we go. Three coffees.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no, I'm sorry. I only ordered one.",
        "WOMAN: You said \"Coffee, coffee, coffee\".",
        "LORELAI: Haha, no, see, I said \"coffee-coffee-coffee\".",
        "WOMAN: Right.",
        "LORELAI: As in I really need coffee-coffee-coffee. You know.",
        "WOMAN: No.",
        "LORELAI: Coffee-coffee-coffee is a saying, like an exaggeration. It's a funny, desperate cry for caffeine. It's just my thing. 'Cause everybody knows I drink a lot of coffee, so the day can't start until I've had my jolt. It's a bit. My bit. [The woman stares blankly at her.] It's not a particularly funny bit unless you know me, then - you know what, three coffees would be great. What do I owe you?",
        "STARS HOLLOW STREET",
        "[Lorelai is driving her Jeep. She drives past Luke's and sees his boat parked out front. She looks hurt. She keeps driving.]",
        "YALE NEWSPAPER OFFICE",
        "[Doyle is leading a staff meeting.]",
        "DOYLE [upset]: I don't know what other words I should use. Perhaps I should talk slower, or have a woman sit in a circle above my head signing my words to you.",
        "GLENN: That would be fresher than you yelling at us.",
        "DOYLE: Glenn.",
        "GLENN: Sorry. But every time I hear you I hear my mother. See my mother -",
        "DOYLE: Stop comparing me to your mother.",
        "GLENN: Stop acting like her.",
        "DOYLE: Anyhow, as I was saying -",
        "GLENN: Pick up your socks!",
        "PARIS: Hey! Our editor's talking!",
        "GLENN: He's your boyfriend, not mine.",
        "PARIS: That has yet to be determined.",
        "RORY [To Glenn]: You're particularly sassy today.",
        "GLENN: I know. It must be my new glasses prescription.",
        "DOYLE: I need all of you to hand in a hard copy of your stories in addition to filing them electronically. Last week our mail server was down and we very nearly missed our deadline. Now how would that have looked?",
        "GLENN: Blank.",
        "DOYLE: Glenn!",
        "GLENN: Sorry. Mom. [He and Rory snicker.]",
        "DOYLE: New system starts today. [Rory sees Marty through the window and gets up to go talk to him.] I want all articles in hard copy on my desk - where are you going?",
        "RORY: I'll be right back.",
        "DOYLE: I'm talking!",
        "RORY: And very well, might I add.",
        "DOYLE: Gilmore!",
        "RORY: Doyle, I could be back by now!",
        "YALE CAMPUS - OUTSIDE THE NEWSPAPER OFFICE",
        "[Marty is buying a coffee. Rory comes outside.]",
        "RORY: Now that's a manly sized cup of coffee.",
        "MARTY: Uh, yeah. I, uh, I worked late, and I had a paper and I didn't get a lot of sleep -",
        "RORY: Marty, you never have to apologize for a huge cup of coffee to me.",
        "MARTY: Right. I know. [He turns and starts walking away. Rory stays with him.]",
        "RORY: So you've been pretty busy lately, huh?",
        "MARTY: Uh, yes.",
        "RORY: Working a lot?",
        "MARTY: Yes.",
        "RORY: Studying a lot?",
        "MARTY: Yes.",
        "RORY: So that's probably why I haven't seen you very much.",
        "MARTY: Yes. Probably.",
        "RORY: I missed you. A lot.",
        "MARTY: Well, I'm sure you've been a little busy yourself.",
        "RORY: I guess. Hey listen, are you working this weekend?",
        "MARTY: Uh, no.",
        "RORY: Great, because I was thinking. It's been ages since we've had a good hangout night.",
        "MARTY: Oh, well -",
        "RORY: We could watch DVD's, order food. Oh, I just got the new Marx Brothers box set. You love the Marx Brothers, Duck Soup!",
        "MARTY: I don't know if I can -",
        "RORY: Did you hear me? I just said Duck Soup.",
        "MARTY: Rory -",
        "RORY: We could watch them all. You know, start early. Make a major marathon thing out of it. Just us. We haven't done this in a long time. Please?",
        "MARTY: Okay. Sounds good.",
        "RORY: Really? Oh, great! [She gives him a hug.] Okay, so on Saturday? Three-ish?",
        "MARTY: Three-ish it is.",
        "RORY: Excellent. Really. Okay, I have to get back, and you have a lot of coffee to drink. So I'll see you Saturday.",
        "MARTY: See you Saturday.",
        "RORY [heading back inside]: Okay!",

        "[Luke serves Andrew his meal.]",
        "ANDREW: Hey Luke, great boat you got out there.",
        "LUKE: Oh, yeah. Thanks.",
        "ANDREW: Are you selling it, or [he covers one eye with his hand and talks in a pirate voice] is it some kind of seafood promotion?",
        "LUKE: I don't want to talk about it!",
        "ANDREW [mumbling]: Good thing you parked it right outside the diner, then.",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "ANDREW [coughs]: Nothing. Nothing.",
        "[Lulu enters with a little boy. Luke is wiping a table.]",
        "LULU: Go on. He's right over there.",
        "[The boy stands very near to Luke but says nothing. Luke finishes wiping the table and suddenly notices him.]",
        "LUKE: Geez, kid! Don't just stand there, you'll give me a heart attack.",
        "[He takes a plate behind the counter, and when he turns around, the boy is standing at the counter looking at him.]",
        "LUKE: Hey.",
        "BRADLEY: Mr. Danes.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, speak up, there, kid. We've got a bit of a height difference here.",
        "BRADLEY: I need to ask you something.",
        "LUKE: Bathrooms are in the back. They're for customers only, so you have to order something. You want to order something? [Bradley shakes his head.] You want to use the bathroom? [Bradley shakes his head again.] Well then what do you want? [Bradley starts sucking on his inhaler.] What are you doing? What's he doing?",
        "LULU: Don't worry. This always happens when he's terrified.",
        "LUKE: What the hell is he terrified of?",
        "LULU: Bradley, would you like me to tell him for you? [Bradley nods.] Okay. Luke.",
        "LUKE: Why's he doing that?",
        "LULU: Oh, he's fine.",
        "LUKE: He doesn't look fine.",
        "LULU: Luke. Luke! [She snaps her fingers] Eyes on me! Eyes on me. Thank you. Now, as you know, I teach third grade over at the elementary school. And our production of Fiddler on the Roof is on Saturday. And Bradley here is in charge of set design. Right, Bradley? [Bradley nods.] So, he just wanted to come here and tell you that he will need you at the school tomorrow at three o'clock. And please bring your own tools. Okay? You did that very well, Bradley!",
        "LUKE: What are you talking about?",
        "LULU: I thought Bradley was very clear.",
        "LUKE: What do you mean, he needs me at the school tomorrow? He needs me at the school to do what?",
        "LULU: To help build the sets.",
        "LUKE: I'm not going to help build any sets.",
        "LULU: But -",
        "LUKE: I have a diner to run. I don't have time to build any sets.",
        "LULU: But Lorelai signed you up weeks ago.",
        "LUKE: She did?",
        "LULU: Yes, she did. She signed you up to build the sets and she signed herself up to make the costumes.",
        "LUKE: Oh, I must have forgot about that.",
        "LULU: Yeah. I know you two are having a little trouble, I mean, I saw the boat. But I figured since it was for the kids you'd still be willing to help.",
        "LUKE: Lorelai's still making the costumes?",
        "LULU: Oh, of course she is. A lot of the parents are helping out, with costumes, make-up, lighting, programs -",
        "LUKE: But you've spoken to her recently, and she's going to be there, making the costumes?",
        "LULU: Look, Luke. If it's going to be too hard for you to be in the same space as Lorelai, I totally -",
        "LUKE: No, it's fine. I'll be there.",
        "LULU: You sure?",
        "LUKE: Yeah, I mean, if other people are going to be helping out, I might as well, you know. It's for the kids - I'll see you tomorrow at three, right?",
        "BRADLEY: With your tools.",
        "LUKE: With my tools.",
        "LULU: That's great. Thank you, Luke. The kids'll be thrilled.",

        "SOOKIE: I guess. Ooo, what's in the bag? [Lorelai opens the bag and displays its contents.] And that is -",
        "LORELAI: A bag of Santa beards.",
        "SOOKIE: Naturally.",
        "LORELAI: I need twenty-five dark beards for Fiddler on the Roof. I drove to four different towns and six different costume shops and this is all I could find. Apparently Lieberman's the only Jew in Connecticut. [Sookie giggles] Hey, can I borrow some tea?",

        "LORELAI: I thought I'd use it to dye them.",

        "SOOKIE: So, other than the great beard search, how was your morning?",
        "LORELAI: Fine.",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah? Good! So, what route did you take to work today?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, the usual. You know, Main Street to Oak and then a sharp starboard turn at the marina and four nautical miles to the Inn.",
        "SOOKIE: You saw it.",

        "SOOKIE: Rats.",

        "LORELAI: No.",

        "LUKE: Oh, yeah.",
        "LULU: Jesus was allergic to peanuts and stuffed one up his nose and broke out in terrible hives during intermission. The second act was all Judas and Pontius Pilate - pure disaster.
