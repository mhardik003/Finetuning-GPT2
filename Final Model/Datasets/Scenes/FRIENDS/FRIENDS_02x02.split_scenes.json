        "JOEY: Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.",
        "ROSS: This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.",
        "CHANDLER: Carol, Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?",

        "MONICA: It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?",
        "CHANDLER: Come on, you're going to Bloomingdales with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.",
        "MONICA: But I'm--",
        "PHOEBE: Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.",
        "ROSS: So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?",
        "MONICA: Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.",
        "ROSS: It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.",

        "RACHEL: You went shopping for fur?",
        "PHOEBE: Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.",
        "RACHEL: You bought boobs?",
        "PHOEBE: Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.",
        "JOEY: Bijan for men? Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work we could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.",
        "ANNABELLE: Oh, actually I sorta have plans.",
        "TODD: Ready, Annabelle?",
        "ANNABELLE: You bet. Maybe some other time?",
        "JOEY: Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men?",
        "CAROL: Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.",
        "ROSS: Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.",

        "MONICA: Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju-- Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.",
        "RACHEL: Did you just say Hi, Jew?",
        "MONICA: Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.",
        "PHOEBE: Ben, dinner!",
        "ROSS: Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.",
        "PHOEBE: Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.",
        "CHANDLER: What did you just do?",
        "PHOEBE: I licked my arm, what?",
        "ROSS: It's breast milk.",
        "PHOEBE: So?",
        "RACHEL: Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.",
        "JOEY: What is the big deal?",
        "CHANDLER: What did you just do?",
        "ROSS: Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?",
        "PHOEBE: You won't even taste it?",
        "ROSS: No!",
        "PHOEBE: Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?",
        "ROSS: Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.",
        "MONICA: Hey, where is everybody?",
        "RACHEL: They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?",
        "MONICA: Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.",
        "RACHEL: Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon. Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?",
        "MONICA: You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.",
        "RACHEL: And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket",
        "MONICA: That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.",
        "RACHEL: Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?",
        "MONICA: Judy.",
        "RACHEL: Who?",
        "MONICA: Julie.",
        "RACHEL: What?",
        "MONICA: Jody.",
        "RACHEL: You were with Julie?",
        "MONICA: Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.",
        "RACHEL: Oh. Oh my god.",
        "MONICA: Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.",
        "RACHEL: Yeah, right.",
        "MONICA: Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out.",
        "RACHEL: Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.",
        "MONICA: That is not true!",
        "RACHEL: Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?",
        "MONICA: Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?",
        "RACHEL: Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdales? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.",
        "MONICA: Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanna, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "CAROL: How did we do?",
        "PHOEBE: Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.",
        "ROSS: I did not freak out.",
        "CAROL: Why'd you freak out?",
        "ROSS: Because it's breast milk. It's gross.",
        "CAROL: My breast milk is gross?",
        "SUSAN: This should be fun.",
        "ROSS: No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults.",
        "CHANDLER: Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.",
        "CAROL: Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.",
        "ROSS: That would be no.",
        "PHOEBE: Come on. It doesn't taste bad.",
        "JOEY: Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh--",
        "SUSAN: Cantaloupe juice.",
        "JOEY: Exactly.",
        "ROSS: You've tasted it? You've tasted it.",
        "SUSAN: Uh huh.",
        "ROSS: Oh, you've tasted it.",
        "SUSAN: You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.",
        "ROSS: Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.",
        "CHANDLER: Howdy.",
        "JOEY: Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.",
        "CHANDLER: Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.",
        "JOEY: Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.",
        "CHANDLER: What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.",
        "JOEY: I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.",
        "CHANDLER: All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?",
        "JOEY: Yeah I guess you're right.",
        "CHANDLER: You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.",
        "JOEY: I'm gonna do it.",
        "CHANDLER: All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.",
        "MONICA: I don't know what else to say.",
        "RACHEL: Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.",
        "MONICA: I feel terrible, I really do.",
        "RACHEL: Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?",
        "MONICA: Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?",
        "RACHEL: Yes.",
        "MONICA: It's that terrible?",
        "RACHEL: Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually, but now she's actually stealing you.",
        "MONICA: Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.",
        "RACHEL: I love you too.",
        "PHOEBE: You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.",
        "MONICA: Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?",
        "RACHEL: I'd do anything for you, you know that.",
        "MONICA: I'd do anything for you.",
        "PHOEBE: Wait, wait, wait, wait!",
        "JOEY: Mornin'. I said, mornin'.",
        "TODD: I heard ya.",
        "STORE GUY: All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?",
        "TODD: Ready.",
        "JOEY: Yeah, I'm ready.",
        "CUSTOMER: You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!",
        "STORE GUY: Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?",
        "TODD: I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.",
        "ANNABELLE: My god, what happened?",
        "JOEY: These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?",
        "ANNABELLE: Sure.",
        "JULIE: So.",
        "RACHEL: So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?",
        "JULIE: I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.",
        "RACHEL: Really? Me?",
        "JULIE: Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.",
        "RACHEL: Well, you're not totally paranoid.",
        "JULIE: Oy.",
        "RACHEL: Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.",
        "JULIE: Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?",
        "RACHEL: Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.",
        "JULIE: I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.",
        "RACHEL: All right, Julie. What a manipulative bitch."
