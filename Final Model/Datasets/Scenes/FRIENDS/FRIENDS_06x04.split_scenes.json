Unable to afford treatment and unwilling to borrow the money from Chandler, he takes on an acting role to renew his insurance, during which the hernia helps out with an uncooperative child star. Ross is given a professorship at NYU and, eager to impress his students, inexplicably lapses into a fake English accent. Rachel discovers she and Ross are still married, and charges into his class yelling at him, unaware the room is filled with students."

        "Rachel: And?",
        "Monica: And it's a magnet!",
        "Rachel: Look at that!",
        "Ross: How weird is that? Y'know? You're moving in with me and have the one thing I don't have. It's like uh, in a way you-you complete me (Phoebe glares at him) kitchen.",
        "Rachel: What?!",
        "Ross: (in an Australian accent) You complete me kitchen, matey!",
        "Phoebe: Ross, I know what you're thinking.",
        "Ross: What?",
        "Phoebe: That she's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad.",
        "Ross: Oh...my...God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!",
        "Phoebe: What?!!",
        "Ross: Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you're obsessed with her. It's always, \"Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?\" \"Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?\" \"When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?\" You want her!",
        "Phoebe: No! (Ross's phone rings.)",

        "Monica: (under her breath) That you're a liar. (Hides the candlesticks in a drawer.)",
        "Ross: (on phone) No-no-no, that's great! I'll be there Monday. And thank you again! (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up) (To All) Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!",
        "Monica: Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?",
        "Ross: Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.",
        "Rachel: Well, who wouldn't?!",
        "Ross: I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it's temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? \"Professor Geller.\"",

        "Chandler: Yeah?",
        "Phoebe: Well, she told me that I'm gonna die this week, so I'm kinda bummed about that.",
        "Chandler: What?!",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, and I know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.",
        "Monica: Phoebe that's crazy!",
        "Joey: I can't believe she would say that too you.",
        "Rachel: Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?",
        "Phoebe: I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.",
        "Chandler: Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?",
        "Phoebe: No, 'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now! (So she picks up the latest copy of Car and Driver (a U.S. auto magazine), leans back, and starts reading.)",
        "Ross: (entering) Hey everyone!",
        "Chandler: Oh hi!",
        "Ross: Hey uh, well, today's my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?",
        "(They pause to think about it.)",
        "All: Oh that'd be great. Sure!",
        "Ross: (he starts reading directly from his cards word for word very quietly) \"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct...\"",
        "Phoebe: Oh, this is it. This what's gonna kill me.",
        "Ross: (continuing) \"...subcategories. The first of these subcategories is...\"",
        "Joey: (interrupting him) Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?",
        "Ross: No! Why?",
        "Joey: Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it.",
        "Ross: Ohh! Okay! Okay. (Resumes reading word for word from the card) \"There are three (pauses and looks at Joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. (Pauses and darts his eyes between Chandler and Rachel.) (Rachel starts laughing) Each of these theories (glances at Phoebe) can be further subcategorized (glances at Chandler) into...\"",
        "Chandler: Why don't you open with a joke?",
        "Ross: Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club!",
        "Chandler: Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!",
        "Ross: (gets up) Okay!",
        "All: Ohh! We're kidding! Oh, we're kidding!",
        "Rachel: Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?",
        "Ross: Thank you!",

        "Joey: Oh-ooh-ooh! Y'know what's a good visual aide?",
        "Ross: Please don't say naked chicks.",
        "Joey: Why not?!",
        "Ross: I-I-I don't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y'know what? I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.",
        "Chandler: That's the way I did it 'til I was 19.",

        "Chandler: Hey.",
        "Joey: Hey! Any good mail?",
        "Chandler: Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.",
        "Joey: Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....",
        "Chandler: (opens and reads it) \"Benefits lapsed.\"",
        "Joey: Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.",
        "Chandler: Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.",
        "Joey: Let me see that!",
        "Chandler: All right.",
        "Joey: (reads it) Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!",
        "Chandler: I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to (pauses) stop catching on fire.",
        "Joey: All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.",
        "Chandler: Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.",
        "Joey: (mocks him, in a whiney voice) ...look both ways before you cross the street. (Turns and walks headlong into the closed door.)",

        "Phoebe: Ugh, it's so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could-(Groans, hacks, and then freezes with her eyes open and her tongue hanging out.)",
        "Rachel: Pheebs, what-what are you doing?",
        "Phoebe: I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?",
        "Rachel: Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can.",
        "(Phoebe goes and lies down as Rachel opens the drawer Monica hid the candlesticks in and as Monica walks out of her room.)",
        "Rachel: Monica!",

        "Rachel: Did-did you take these back?",
        "Monica: No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.",
        "Rachel: Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?",
        "Monica: I loved them!",
        "Rachel: Yeah. (Monica walks away) Nice try! (Rachel puts them in a box.)",

        "Rachel: Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.",
        "Ross: I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone's all, \"Ross you have to be funny and sexy.\" Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.",
        "Monica: That you're not funny or sexy?",
        "Ross: That's right!",

        "Chandler: That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?",
        "Joey: What?!",
        "Chandler: What's wrong with you?",
        "Joey: Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.",
        "Chandler: This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!",
        "Joey: No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and shows Chandler.)",
        "Chandler: That's a hernia.",

        "Chandler: Hey, will you grab me a cruller? (Joey starts to groan and get up.) Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!",
        "Joey: Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.",
        "Chandler: I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.",
        "Joey: Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.",
