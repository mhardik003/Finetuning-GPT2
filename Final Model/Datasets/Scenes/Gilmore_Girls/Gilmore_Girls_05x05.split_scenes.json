    "Recap": [
        "The demands of the electorate are beginning to get to Jackson. Lorelai and Rory delicately nudge Richard and Emily closer together. Lorelai decides that a double date with Rory and Dean is the way to smooth over the bumps in her relationship with Dean, but the evening goes awry when Luke can't get over feeling that Dean isn't good enough for Rory. Richard takes up a new hobby, and Emily buys a panic room. Failing to get a response from Zack about the declaration of her feelings, Lane rescinds them, which finally gets Zack talking. Lorelai introduces Luke to \" Pippi Longstocking \" as Kirk gets much better acquainted with Lulu during movie night at the Black & White & Read Bookstore."

        "OPEN IN DRAGONFLY INN",
        "[Camera follows a member of the kitchen staff through the door into the kitchen. Sookie cuts and preps food while she and Lorelai discuss Inn issues.]",
        "LORELAI: It's getting the word out to the business community that we're here -- that's the key.",
        "SOOKIE: We've got to draw them in with the things that they like -- amenities.",
        "[Lorelai pours coffee into her mug while Sookie prepares food portions]",
        "LORELAI: What does a businessman want when they travel? Booze, and hookers. Anything else?",
        "SOOKIE: [grins] I think that covers it.",
        "LORELAI: We got booze. How do we get hookers?",
        "SOOKIE: How about a banner up front that reads \"Hoes up at the Dragonfly\"?",
        "LORELAI: Or we tell them Bill Maher's here.",
        "SOOKIE: [ Gasps ] They'd come a-flocking.",
        "LORELAI: Maybe we're in too silly a mood to be discussing such serious stuff.",
        "SOOKIE: You think?",
        "[Jackson enters with a laden crate of vegetables. The only thing out of place is the business suit he is wearing]",
        "LORELAI: Oh hey Jackson, what would you do to lure more businessmen to the Dragonfly? Besides inviting Bill Maher.",
        "JACKSON: What do I look like, the Shell Answer Man? Everybody's gotta have a piece of Jackson. Well, he's got nothing left, I tell you, nothing.",
        "SOOKIE: [sympathetic] His town selectman duties are starting to wear on him.",
        "LORELAI: That's why the fancy duds?",
        "SOOKIE: He's got functions every day and meetings and hearings.",
        "JACKSON: I tried to work in a nice suicide, but my schedule wouldn't allow it. [ Cellphone rings ] Ugh, That sound's death to me.",
        "LORELAI: Don't answer it.",
        "JACKSON: Could be a customer. Hello? [strained patience] Yes, Mrs. Cassini. I got the note about the playground equipment.",
        "[Jackson leans against a nearby ledge while talking, and the jacket gapes to expose a bright red stain on his dress shirt.]",
        "LORELAI: [points] Oh God, is that blood?",
        "SOOKIE: It's tomato. It happens daily. Disrobe.",
        "[Without hesitation, Sookie nimbly removes his tie while Jackson continues talking, then slides off his jacket and hands it to Lorelai. She efficiently begins unbuttoning his shirt.]",
        "JACKSON: So you say your granddaughter fell off the ducky? Oh, she fell off the piggy and she whacked her arm on the ducky. Uh-huh. I see. Well, the first thing I would do is question the horsy, 'cause he's right next to the piggy and is our most reliable witness.[weak chuckle] No, there's nothing funny about that, Mrs. Cassini. Nothing whatsoever.",
        "SOOKIE: Arms up, big boy.",
        "[She slips the dress shirt off him, leaving him in an undershirt and begins spot-cleaning the stain at the sink. ]",
        "JACKSON: No, a little girl being thrown from a pink, spring-loaded, bobbling piggy toy is very serious business. Yes, Mrs. Cassini. [walks off]",
        "LORELAI: I don't think that's gonna come out.",
        "SOOKIE: Poor guy. He's only got two dress shirts.",
        "[She continues to rub and blot the stain.]",
        "LORELAI: Well, maybe a big old bloodstain will help him. People will think there was an assassination attempt and be more sympathetic.",
        "[Lorelai glances out through the kitchen door and see Dean standing in the hall. As their eyes meet, Lorelai attempts a weak wave, but Dean immediately pretends to be distracted in another direction and leaves. Lorelai is puzzled. Jackson walks up again still talking on the cell phone.]",
        "JACKSON: I do. I hear what you're saying, Mrs. Cassini. Yes, Mrs. Cassini. I'll talk to my parks and recreation chairman and get this solved I promise. Goodbye, Mrs. Cassini.",
        "SOOKIE: It's a goner.",
        "JACKSON: I know how it feels. I gotta go. I got a Kiwanis luncheon.",
        "SOOKIE: Have fun.",
        "[she hands him back his shirt and returns to work. Jackson gathers his clothes and prepares to leave. Lorelai produces a rumpled, folded paper and offers to him.]",
        "LORELAI: Jackson, before you go, I need your John Hancock on that there.",
        "JACKSON: Oh yeah?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, just right at the bottom. I was just ordering a ton of extra, you know, vegetables and stuff. It's just to sign and confirm that I'm ordering that stuff.",
        "[He unfolds the paper as she immediately takes interest out the window]",
        "JACKSON: Hey, this is for those extra parking spaces you need. It's selectman business.",
        "LORELAI: Really?",
        "JACKSON: Et tu, former friend?",
        "[He leaves as she calls after him]",
        "LORELAI: I just need your signature. It's your duty. [reluctantly takes paper and pen back]",
        "JACKSON: So impeach me.",
        "[Sookie appears and snatches the paper from Lorelai.]",
        "SOOKIE: I'll forge that for you.",
        "LORELAI: Thanks.",
        "CUT TO YALE'S BRANFORD COLLEGE CAMPUS CAFETERIA",
        "[Richard and Rory takes their laden trays to a nearby table and sit.]",
        "RICHARD: So Dickie high tails it to his office and e-mails me within seconds.",
        "RORY: Dickie's the other you at your office, right?",
        "RICHARD: Well, there's no other me.",
        "RORY: You know what I meant, Grandpa.",
        "RICHARD: Dickie and I share some duties. We lunch occasionally, socialize a bit. But he would cut my throat in a heartbeat, as I would his.",
        "RORY: It's like Rikers Island, except everyone drives a Jag.",
        "RICHARD: [chuckles] Well, Dickie made a mistake. He e-mailed me, thinking that I wouldn't read it for days, but I read it the minute he sent it. He figured my weekend starts at lunch on Fridays, as so many others do -- error followed by error.",
        "RORY: That man needs to reread his Sun Tzu.",
        "RICHARD: Anyway, that's why I am missing Friday Night dinner. Dickie and I are going to be in the Chicago office.",
        "RORY: Well, send me a postcard.",
        "RICHARD: I'm traveling much less, but I don't miss it. Thirty years ago, any chance I had to travel, I jumped at, but now... I'm talking a lot, aren't I?",
        "RORY: No. I mean, yes. But it's good.",
        "RICHARD: I don't want to be tiresome.",
        "RORY: Grandpa, you could never tire me. This is fun.",
        "RICHARD: Good. My valet isn't much of a conversationalist. He's the master of the monosyllable, although he can shine a shoe with the best of them. So, been reading anything good lately?",
        "RORY: I'm very into P.G. Wodehouse right now.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, that's great.",
        "RORY: You?",
        "RICHARD: Actually, I've had a personal triumph of late.",
        "RORY: Oh, yeah? What?",
        "RICHARD: I've just finished the sixth and final volume of \"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.\"",
        "RORY: [stunned] That *is* a triumph.",
        "RICHARD: I started it in 1968. So it took only -- what? -- 36 years to finish it. But by God, I finished it.",
        "RORY: Wow. That's quite a commitment.",
        "RICHARD: Well, I've had a little more time on my hands lately. Not as many evenings out as there once were.",
        "RORY: [quietly] Right. Not as many.",
        "RICHARD: You're still getting together with your grandmother tonight, aren't you?",
        "RORY: Uh-huh.",
        "RICHARD: Has she mentioned her car lately?",
        "RORY: Her car?",
        "RICHARD: It's due for its six-month service. I hope she isn't skipping those.",
        "RORY: I don't know. I'm happy to ask.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, no. That's too much trouble. I'll have Robert check with her maid.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "RICHARD: He may have to use upwards of six syllables for this one. I wish him luck.",
        "RORY: Couldn't you just ask her yourself, Grandpa? I mean, you're right there.",
        "RICHARD: No, I don't want to be an annoyance.",
        "RORY: Okay. But, Grandpa --",
        "RICHARD: Chicken's getting cold.",
        "RORY: Right.",
        "RICHARD: I saw the most preposterous thing on TV the other night. It's been ages since I've just flipped through the channels, and the horrors to be discovered there.",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER.",
        "[Luke wipes down a clear table. Lorelai enters.]",
        "LUKE: Hey, what brings you here?",
        "LORELAI: Caffeine withdrawal. And I like looking at you.",
        "[Luke returns behind the counter to fetch coffee as Lorelai approaches.]",
        "LUKE: To go?",
        "LORELAI: To go. [pulls open her purse]",
        "LUKE: Don't worry about it.",
        "LORELAI: Luke, this is your business. I've always paid, and I always should pay.",
        "LUKE: Fine, but don't tip me. Tipping now is weird.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. Besides, [exaggerated wink] I can tip you later.",
        "LUKE: That was weird, too.",
        "LORELAI: I'm a very awkward winker.",
        "LUKE: You're never supposed to tip me, anyway.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "LUKE: I'm the proprietor. You're not supposed to tip the proprietor, even when they serve you.",
        "[hands her the tall \"to-go\" cup of coffee]",
        "LORELAI: You mean all those years, that extra 20% was unnecessary?",
        "LUKE: [scoffs] You never tipped me 20%.",
        "LORELAI: Ooh. Now it's getting ugly.",
        "LUKE: You were a solid 15 percenter, sometimes less if the bill got higher. Way less if you were mad at me about something.",
        "LORELAI: [grinning] Well, it doesn't matter. I wasn't supposed to be tipping you, anyway.",
        "LUKE: True.",
        "LORELAI: In fact, I want a rebate.",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: [dryly] You've been ripping me off for ten years.",
        "LUKE: Have your lawyer call my lawyer.",
        "LORELAI: Thank you [picks up her steaming coffee]",
        "LUKE: [without pause] We still on for tomorrow night?",
        "LORELAI: Absolutely.",
        "LUKE: Talk to you later.",
        "LORELAI: Bye.",
        "CUT TO EXTERIOR OF LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Lorelai exits and almost bumps into Dean as he walks by. He is carrying his Doose's produce apron]",
        "DEAN: Oh hi, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Hi, Dean. Um, good to bump into you.",
        "DEAN: Yeah, same here. [hesitatingly looks around] Um, you on your way back to work?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. You?",
        "DEAN: Yeah. I'm going to Doose's.",
        "LORELAI: [conversationally] You were just at the inn.",
        "DEAN: Yeah, Tom wanted me to sand some doors down. They were getting a little warped.",
        "LORELAI: I saw you in the hallway there, but you looked kind of busy.",
        "DEAN: [slightly embarrassed] Yeah, I-I saw you, too.",
        "LORELAI: Oh. [Dean looks around uncomfortably] So, how's our girl?",
        "DEAN: Rory?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "DEAN: Uh, she's good. I saw her like three days ago, or a couple days ago. But yeah, she's good.",
        "LORELAI: Good. Well, I talked to her this morning, so I win. [chuckles and smiles] Not that it's a contest.",
        "DEAN: [grins back] Right.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I guess I'll see you around. Next time you're at the inn, find me. We could have some coffee and chew the fat. Sounds like a disgusting combination, but anyway come by.",
        "DEAN: I will. Sure. Absolutely.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "DEAN: So have a good day.",
        "LORELAI: You too.",
        "[They both awkwardly part company]",
        "CUT TO ELDER GILMORE HOME - ENTRYWAY",
        "[ Doorbell rings ]",
        "EMILY: I'll get it, Sara.",
        "[Emily briskly approaches and opens the door.]",
        "LORELAI: Hi, Mom.",
        "EMILY: Come in, come in.",
        "LORELAI: I'm sorry I'm late. Traffic was bad. Some moron coming out of Stars Hollow decided to go the speed limit, which is -- ooh! [she stares into the foyer] What the hell is that?",
        "[A large metal boxlike structure stands in the center of the room.]",
        "EMILY: What does it look like? It's a panic room.",
        "LORELAI: Like Jodie Foster?",
        "EMILY: I have no idea.",
        "LORELAI: But it's very small. It's more like an anxiety room.",
        "EMILY: It's for one person.",
        "LORELAI: Huh?",
        "EMILY: You could maybe squeeze two in.",
        "[Lorelai approaches the large object and begins fussing with it. Opening the door and looking inside]",
        "LORELAI: And when those two are done panicking, the next couple of panickers get a turn?",
        "EMILY: It's primarily for me.",
        "LORELAI: Why the foyer?",
        "EMILY: It was supposed to go upstairs, but the boors who delivered it claimed they weren't told about the stairs, so they didn't have the right equipment.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, let's test it out. I'm gonna get you. [raises her hands like claws]",
        "EMILY: [disgusted] Oh, my God.",
        "LORELAI: You better get in there, 'cause I'm a bad guy. Baah!",
        "EMILY: Stop it.",
        "LORELAI: I'm menacing. Panic, damn it. Come on.",
        "EMILY: There's nothing funny about this.",
        "[ Doorbell rings ]",
        "LORELAI: Oh! Get in, quick! Quick!",
        "EMILY: Stop it.",
        "[Emily walks to the door to open it. Rory kisses Emily's cheek and enters.]",
        "RORY: Hi, Grandma. So -- hey, what's that?",
        "[Lorelai stands next to the heavy structure like a car show model.]",
        "LORELAI: I know how to protect you from shrapnel and Agent Orange. Ask me how.",
        "EMILY: It's a panic room.",
        "RORY: Like Jodie Foster?",
        "EMILY: What does Jodie Foster have to do with this?",
        "LORELAI: [teasing] You need one for your dorm.",
        "EMILY: That's not a stupid thought. It'll stop a 9-millimeter shell.",
        "LORELAI: Handy for when Suge Knight comes for tea.",
        "RORY: Why is it here?",
        "EMILY: It's a long story. Come, let's have drinks and forget about the panic room. What'll you have?",
        "LORELAI: Gin martini.",
        "RORY: A soda with lime.",
        "EMILY: This little rinky-dink cart has nothing.",
        "LORELAI: Dad got the big one?",
        "EMILY: He stole it away in the dark of night, so I'm stranded. I had our minister over a couple of days ago, and he had to go without his whiskey sour.",
        "LORELAI: I bet he excommunicated you on the spot.",
        "EMILY: I've got vermouth, but no gin. [sarcastic] Perfect. [calls out loudly] Sara?",
        "[Sara, the maid, descends the stairs and approaches hurriedly]",
        "SARA: Yes, ma'am?",
        "EMILY: I need gin. Check everywhere.",
        "LORELAI: Including the bathtub.",
        "EMILY: Start with the pantry.",
        "SARA: Yes, ma'am.",
        "[Sara exits as Emily joins Lorelai and Rory]",
        "EMILY: You know, the main reason I got the panic room is because I'm a woman living alone.",
        "LORELAI: Well, let the record show I did not bring up the panic room.",
        "EMILY: Do you know I've never lived alone? I went from my parents' house to college to Richard.",
        "RORY: But, Grandma, you're not alone alone. Grandpa is only a few feet away.",
        "EMILY: He might as well be a million miles away. I don't even know if your grandfather would look up from his stamp collection if he heard me scream.",
        "RORY: That's not true.",
        "LORELAI: Unless his nose got stuck to the stamp in the book and he physically couldn't look up. [Rory looks reprovingly at Lorelai] It happens.",
        "EMILY: He's gone so much, he's no protection, anyway. He just left on some business trip, and it's an afterthought that he even bothered to tell me about it at all.",
        "RORY: But he told you, so that's not an afterthought. That's a thought - a very thoughtful thought.",
        "EMILY: I'm sure it was in some way for his own convenience.",
        "SARA: [returns empty-handed] There's no gin anywhere, Mrs. Gilmore.",
        "EMILY: Oh, perfect.",
        "SARA: I'll check the bathtub now.",
        "EMILY: That was a joke, Sara. Lorelai, please don't joke with the maids. It's not what they do.",
        "LORELAI: Sorry.",
        "EMILY: [to Sara] Check Mr. Gilmore's study.",
        "SARA: Yes, ma'am. [exits]",
        "EMILY: I should just call Richard myself and drag him away from whatever business meal he is having and make him tell me.",
        "RORY: It's okay. Mom doesn't need a martini. [to her mother] Right?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. Right. I'll take what you got. What's good enough for the minister is good enough for me.",
        "EMILY: Your hands are empty.",
        "SARA: [returns a little more tentatively] The door to the study is locked.",
        "EMILY: He locked the study?",
        "LORELAI: Mom, really, I don't need gin. I'll take whatever you have.",
        "EMILY: I don't have anything. That's the problem. Come on. [she stands up]",
        "RORY: Come on where?",
        "EMILY: [pulls a set of keys from the nearby bureau a walks off.] I'm not going to let Richard's business trip keep you from having the drink you want.",
        "RORY: Grandma, wait. [Lorelai and Rory follow Emily]",
        "CUT TO POOL HOUSE - RICHARD'S PRIMARY RESIDENCE",
        "[Emily enters the darkened room and flips on the nearby light switch]",
        "RORY: Should we really be doing this?",
        "EMILY: Oh, that he can live in this squalor.",
        "LORELAI: It's another Calcutta. Is that open sewage?",
        "EMILY: It certainly smells like a sewer in here.",
        "RORY: It's his cigars. That's the smell.",
        "EMILY: It's more than cigars. It's debauchery.",
        "LORELAI: [dryly] Yeah. Dad mentioned he had the Barbi twins up here a couple nights ago. He and his butler have a little \"auto focus\" thing going on.",
        "RORY: Well, the drink cart's over there, Grandma. We can grab the gin and vamoose.",
        "LORELAI: [shtick] No, she's got vamoose, remember? It's the gin we need. - But you know -",
        "EMILY: He must have five packs of breath mints here. Why would a man need five packs of breath mints?",
        "LORELAI: It could be the gorgonzola and onion diet he's on. It has its drawbacks.",
        "RORY: Grandma, I feel kind of weird snooping like this.",
        "[Emily slides open desk drawers and snoops before wandering across the room]",
        "EMILY: This is my property as much as his, and when we die, it'll be yours. We're all entitled here. He's got some new books. [browses though the bookcase]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, my Petunia Pig plate and spoon. What's it doing here?",
        "EMILY: Oh, odds and ends wound up out here over the years.",
        "LORELAI: This is not an odd nor an end. It's my Petunia Pig and I'm taking it.",
        "RORY: It's not yours to take.",
        "LORELAI: [stubbornly] Dad's not using my Petunia Pig spoon.",
        "EMILY: I say take it.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, Mom, what are we carrying our booty home in? Do you have a canvas bag with a big dollar sign on it?",
        "RORY: Okay. Just to remind you once again, the drink cart is right over here. Oh, and I think I spot gin. It's brown, right?",
        "LORELAI: I love that you think that. [spies Emily in Richard's closet] Looking for skeletons?",
        "EMILY: I'm just looking.",
        "RORY: Oh, man. I spilled a ton of scotch on my skirt. Who's not closing these bottles?",
        "EMILY: Oh, my God.",
        "LORELAI: Did you really find a skeleton?",
        "RORY: Okay, Gin -- it's clear, it's in my hand, and it looks good enough for a minister. Let's go.",
        "EMILY: Oh, my God. Will you look at this? [Shocked, she pulls out a vest dressed in colorful sequins]",
        "RORY: Bright.",
        "LORELAI: [dryly] And tasteful.",
        "EMILY: It's a vest.",
        "RORY: Grandpa has lots of vests.",
        "EMILY: It's got glitter. It's a glitter vest.",
        "LORELAI: So?",
        "EMILY: So? Where would your father wear a vest like this? Certainly nowhere he ever would've taken me.",
        "RORY: Grandma, it's just a vest.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah Mom. There's tons of places he would wear that.",
        "EMILY: Name one.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, I'm at a loss.",
        "EMILY: This is insane.",
        "LORELAI: Mom, this is the place where unwanted things came to repose. Maybe it's a vest of his from the old days.",
        "EMILY: Our days never included Richard dressing up like that gay fellow whose tiger tried to eat him. I have definitely, positively never seen this vest. This is a party vest.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, just put it back, Mom, and let's go.",
        "EMILY: [holds out the festive garment] You put it back.",
        "RORY: You know, we've moved a lot of stuff around here tonight. We've got to cover our tracks.",
        "LORELAI: Where did you find it?",
        "EMILY: Squished in the middle, as if he was hiding it from me.",
        "LORELAI: [mutters as she returns the vest to the closet] Can you blame him? It's hideous.",
        "EMILY: How dare he have a vest like that.",
        "RORY: Okay, the mints looked something like this, right?",

        "LORELAI: Pippi?",
        "LUKE: She can have adventures and be free, she's smart. The whole world's waiting for her.",
        "LORELAI: [disbelief] You're comparing Rory to Pippi Longstocking?",
        "LUKE: [counting attributes on his fingers] Pippi is strong and independent. She can lift a horse above her head. Uh-huh. And beat up bullies and build a hot-air balloon. She's unique, like Rory. But I guarantee you, if Pippi had met Dean, [Lorelai sighs] there would be no horse, no balloons. He'd drag her down to his level, spend all her gold coins, and poof, like that, all her dreams would be gone.",
        "LORELAI: It's Rory's choice who she chooses to be with. Not yours, not mine.",
