        "[Lorelai, Rory, Michel, and Sookie are sitting at a table in the dining room listening to music]",
        "SOOKIE: Huh?",
        "LORELAI: Sookie, you've gotta be kidding.",
        "SOOKIE: What?",
        "LORELAI: You cannot walk down the aisle to that.",
        "SOOKIE: Why?",
        "LORELAI: It's depressing.",
        "SOOKIE: It's Ella.",
        "LORELAI: It's morbid.",
        "SOOKIE: It's a classic song.",
        "LORELAI: A classic song with lyrics about a woman who can't make her relationship work, whose life is filled with emptiness and regret and pain.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, who listens to the lyrics?",
        "LORELAI: Anybody not hanging out with Annie Sullivan by the water pump.",
        "RORY: What are these?",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, those are some alternative songs, but I really like this one the best.",
        "LORELAI: Alternative songs, good. Let's see. Hey Jude.",
        "SOOKIE: Paul wrote it for Julian to cheer him up.",
        "LORELAI: Seasons in the Sun?",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, a sentimental favorite.",
        "LORELAI: Cat's in the Cradle?",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, it makes you re-examine your priorities.",
        "LORELAI: Don't Cry Out Loud? Sookie, do you even like Jackson?",
        "MICHEL: Okay, I have a wonderful suggestion.",
        "LORELAI: Great, let's hear it.",
        "MICHEL: Okay, here we go. How about I leave?",
        "LORELAI: And then do what?",
        "MICHEL: That's it. I leave and I don't have to listen to this insanity anymore. What do you think, huh? Because I love it.",
        "LORELAI: Michel, I am in the wedding, which means you have to run the wedding all by yourself, something you've never done before.",
        "MICHEL: Oh, please.",
        "RORY: I'll tell you what, Sookie. How about Lane and I come up with a few more suggestions for you? Still melodic, but not quite as Girl, Interrupted.",
        "SOOKIE: All right, fine.",
        "LORELAI: Great. Michel, how's the RSVP list coming?",
        "MICHEL: Well, I must say this has been especially challenging for me. I mean, when you are talking about a wedding with up to forty people all living within a five mile radius, how can one person be expected to keep track of all of that?",
        "LORELAI: Just an answer will do.",
        "MICHEL: I mean, it got a little hairy there for a moment \u0096 I almost had to use a second sheet of paper, you know.",
        "LORELAI: You know, I'm not gonna let you annoy me out of making you handle this.",
        "MICHEL: Oh, we'll see.",
        "SOOKIE: Hey, my cousin Carl canceled so I have two empty seats. Anyone else you wanna invite?",
        "RORY: I've got Lane, I've got Dean, I'm good.",
        "SOOKIE: What about Emily and Richard?",
        "LORELAI: Emily and Richard who?",
        "SOOKIE: Your Emily and Richard.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Sookie, you are way too sweet.",
        "SOOKIE: What? She went to all that trouble to help me plan the first phase of the wedding.",
        "LORELAI: The crazy phase of the wedding.",
        "SOOKIE: It was still sweet and I appreciated it. I mean, if it wasn't for your mother, I never would've settled on the color pink.",
        "LORELAI: Why is that?",
        "SOOKIE: Well, I wanted yellow and she said no.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, with logic like that.",
        "SOOKIE: Come on, just ask her. I want you to.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, I'll ask her.",
        "SOOKIE: Good.",
        "LORELAI: What are you doing?",
        "SOOKIE: It's get happier the second time you hear it.",
        "LORELAI: Unh.",
        "SOOKIE: Huh? Snappier, isn't it?",

        "[Rory, Lorelai, and Emily are sitting in the living room before dinner.]",
        "LORELAI: Huh. You know what I just realized? Oy is the funniest word in the entire world.",
        "RORY: Huh.",
        "LORELAI: I mean, think about it. You never hear the word oy and not smile. Impossible. Funny, funny word.",
        "EMILY: Oh, dear God.",
        "LORELAI: Poodle is another funny word.",
        "EMILY: Please drink your drink, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: In fact, if you put oy and poodle together in the same sentence, you'd have a great new catch phrase, you know? Like, oy with the poodles already. So from now on, when the perfect circumstances arise, we will use our favorite new catch phrase.",
        "RORY: Oy with the poodles already.",
        "LORELAI: I'm telling you, it's knocking \u0091whatcha talking \u0091bout, Willis?' right out of first place.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai, for God's sake, be quiet.",
        "MAID: Dinner's ready, Mrs. Gilmore.",
        "EMILY: Bless you, Inga. Please go tell Mr. Gilmore. He's in his den.",
        "MAID: Yes, ma'am.",
        "EMILY: Shall we?",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, hey Mom, uh, Sookie wanted to know if you and Dad would like to come to her wedding.",
        "EMILY: Really?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, it's gonna be great. Small, low key, but fun. She's catering it herself so the food'll be fantastic, and you'd get to see me and Rory walk down the aisle in two of the least obnoxious bridesmaid dresses ever created.",
        "EMILY: Well, that sounds very nice. When is it?",
        "LORELAI: A week from Sunday.",
        "EMILY: A week from Sunday?",
        "LORELAI: Yes.",
        "EMILY: The wedding is in one week?",
        "LORELAI: Yes.",
        "EMILY: So this is a pity invite?",
        "LORELAI: A what?",
        "EMILY: Someone canceled at the last minute and rather than being left with two empty seats, Sookie asked you to ask us. How nice.",
        "LORELAI: That's not what happened.",
        "EMILY: No, that's quite all right. Far be it from me to be invited with the first batch of actual wanted guests. This is just fine.",
        "LORELAI: Mom, it's not a pity invite. She really wants you to come.",
        "EMILY: Is that so?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, that's so.",
        "EMILY: Where's our invitation?",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "EMILY: Our invitation. I mean, she must've at least given you an invitation to give us.",
        "LORELAI: She thought it would be more special coming directly from me.",
        "EMILY: So she was out of invitations. I never felt so special.",
        "LORELAI: Mom, she wants you to come. There's no reason to be insulted here.",
        "EMILY: I guess I should be thrilled that I didn't just get a call from the road as you were on your way there.",
        "LORELAI: Do not turn this into something that it's not.",
        "EMILY: Do we have a choice between chicken or fish, or at this point do we just bring our own?",
        "LORELAI: Stop.",
        "EMILY: Perhaps she would also like us to pick up some extra ice along the way, or help out parking the cars.",
        "LORELAI: Mom, look, isn't Rory pretty?",
        "RICHARD: Apologies all around. I could not get Adamson off the phone.",
        "LORELAI: Dad, glad you're here. We're just talking about how pretty Rory is. Big eyes, baby. Give him the Bambi face.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, Rory gets lovelier every day.",
        "RORY: Why, thank you, Grandpa.",
        "EMILY: Oh Richard?",
        "LORELAI: Oh my God.",
        "EMILY: Guess what Lorelai just told me?",
        "RICHARD: What?",
        "EMILY: We are invited to Sookie's wedding.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, how nice. When is it?",
        "EMILY: A week from Sunday.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, so it's a pity invite.",
        "EMILY: Ha!",

        "DEAN: Good.",
        "RORY: Good or really good?",
        "DEAN: Good.",
        "RORY: So, not really good?",
        "DEAN: Fine, really good.",
        "RORY: Okay. But are they great?",
        "DEAN: Rory, uh, would you perhaps like to trade breakfasts?",
        "RORY: You mean, your pancakes for my eggs?",
        "DEAN: Yup.",
        "RORY: Um, okay. Wow, you're crazy, these pancakes are great.",
        "[Lorelai walks by the window outside]",
        "DEAN: That's twelve.",
        "RORY: Mm, two more and she'll come in.",
        "DEAN: I don't know. She's been walking back and forth out there for twenty minutes and she still hasn't made it to the door.",
        "RORY: Yeah, but look how much closer to the building she's gotten.",
        "DEAN: Why don't we just bring her something out?",
        "RORY: No. She and Luke have been in this fight for too long, she's gotta do this.",
        "DEAN: You're cruel.",
        "RORY: Tough love, baby. Oops, I think she's coming in.",
        "DEAN: How can you tell?",
        "RORY: She's got shoe sale face on.",
        "[Lorelai walks in and sits down]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, I did it, I'm in.",
        "RORY: Good girl.",
        "LORELAI: It wasn't so bad. Took awhile, but not so bad. Wait, why are you eating?",
        "RORY: You took thirty minutes to come in.",
        "LORELAI: But I'm here now and hey, I'm like cheese.",
        "DEAN: What?",
        "RORY: She gets better with time.",
        "DEAN: Ah.",
        "RORY: Sorry gouda, we've got school.",

        "RORY: Order breakfast and I'll leave you the paper.",
        "LORELAI: No, but \u0096",
        "RORY: I'll see you tonight.",
        "LORELAI: Dean, don't leave me.",
        "RORY: You'll do fine. You'll do fine.",
        "[Rory and Dean leave; Lorelai walks up to Luke at the counter]",
        "LORELAI: Hey.",
        "LUKE: Hello.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, good donut selection this morning, really. Good variety, good color, good goodness, good . . . Well, so the choices are there. It all comes down to what I'm in the mood for. Sprinkled or chocolate or jelly or glazed, maple or kiki or apple or, uh, raised. Little donut rhyme there. Never mind. Can I have a chocolate and a sprinkled please?",
        "LUKE: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: So, this is how it's gonna be with us now, huh?",
        "LUKE: No idea what you're talking about.",
        "LORELAI: You're pulling a Mr. Freeze on me.",
        "LUKE: I'm not pulling a Mr. Freeze on you.",
        "LORELAI: Please. I'm gonna need snow chains just to get out of here.",
        "LUKE: I assume you want coffee with your donuts.",
        "LORELAI: I'm sorry, Luke. It was a bad night. I completely freaked out. I said some things. . .did you get my note? I wrote you a note.",
        "LUKE: Got your note.",
        "LORELAI: You got my note. Did you read my note?",
        "LUKE: Read your note.",
        "LORELAI: And?",
        "LUKE: It was very well-written",
        "LORELAI: That's it?",
        "LUKE: I also enjoyed the Garfield stationary. That's one funny cat.",
        "LORELAI: I said I was sorry, Luke.",
        "LUKE: Yes, you did.",
        "LORELAI: I said it like a million times.",
        "LUKE: You said it four times, but I understand you're embellishing for dramatic effects.",
        "LORELAI: Stop.",
        "LUKE: Stop what?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, stop this robot talk. If you're mad, just act like you're mad at me.",
        "LUKE: I'm not mad at you.",
        "LORELAI: You're being really, really unfair. Rory was in the hospital.",
        "LUKE: Lorelai, what is it exactly that you want me to do? I'm not mad, I'm not holding a grudge, I heard your apology, I feel I'm being polite, I listened to your donut bit, I got you your coffee. What would make you happy?",
        "LORELAI: I want Luke back.",
        "LUKE: He's standing right here.",
        "LORELAI: No, he's not.",

        "CUT TO CHILTON AUDITORIUM",
        "[Paris is at a podium on stage addressing a room full of students]",
        "PARIS: Better drinking fountains, updated lockers, clearly marked boys' and girls' restrooms, non-dairy and wheat-free alternatives to the cafeteria, a larger voice in the monetary dispersal of charitable funds donated to our institution \u0096 because it is our institution, yours and mine. Remember people, if Chilton soars, we soar. If Chilton fails, we fail. It is up to us, we must get involved, we must care. It is not enough to sign a petition to get a Little Debbie machine installed in the senior corridor. Snack cakes will not change the world. Cream filling will not decide our legacy. How will future generations of Chilton students remember the class of 2003? John F. Kennedy once said, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country. Those eloquent words are just as relevant to here in this hall today. What can you, the future of Chilton, of America, of the world, what can you do for your school? I will tell you what you can do. You can vote for me, Paris Gellar, for student body president, and let me start tomorrow for you today. Thank you.",
        "MRS. O'MALLEY: Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Reese McGinly, Schatzi Leason and Paris Gellar, your presidential candidates for next year. Elections will be held this Friday. Good luck to all of you. This concludes today's assembly. You are all dismissed.",
        "[As people exit the auditorium, Paris walks over to Rory, who is writing in a notebook]",
        "PARIS: Hey.",
        "RORY: Hey.",
        "PARIS: Did you get the Little Debbie comment?",
        "RORY: Uh huh.",
        "PARIS: All of it? The cream filling, the snack cake?",
        "RORY: Every delicious morsel.",
        "PARIS: Good, good. So, how do you think it went?",
        "RORY: I think it went fine.",
        "PARIS: Fine, as is better than Reese and Schatzi?",
        "RORY: Fine as in fine.",
        "PARIS: Well, how are you skewing the article?",
        "RORY: Well, you'll have to wait and read about it in the Franklin like everyone else.",
        "PARIS: Fine, write whatever you want.",
        "RORY: I will.",
        "PARIS: Just make sure you mention that Schatzi pulling the Sharon Stone/Basic Instinct bit was a cheap attempt to distract the whole student body from my mandatory recycling program.",
        "RORY: Go away, Randolph.",
        "[Madeline and Paris enter the auditorium]",
        "MADELINE: We got it!",
        "PARIS: [walks over to them] You do? Well, come on, tell me.",
        "LOUISE: Okay, a hundred and fifty students were polled.",
        "MADELINE: A total cross section.",
        "LOUISE: We talked to people that we should never have even had to stand near.",
        "MADELINE: The hairstyles alone proved the Farrelly brothers are not making this stuff up.",
        "PARIS: I'm sorry, have I ever been mistaken for a patient person?",
        "MADELINE: Right, sorry. Okay, so we added the votes up.",
        "PARIS: You added?",
        "MADELINE: She added.",
        "PARIS: Good, continue.",
        "MADELINE: Okay, when asked which of the three candidates is the most qualified for the job of president, ninety percent said you.",
        "PARIS: Really?",
        "LOUISE: And when asked who of the three candidates would be the most competent president, overwhelmingly the answer was once again you.",
        "PARIS: So that's it, I'm in.",
        "MADELINE: Not quite.",
        "PARIS: How is that not quite? Most competent and most qualified, what else is there?",
        "LOUISE: Well, we also polled likability.",
        "PARIS: And?",
        "MADELINE: And while people think you're smart. . .",
        "PARIS: And competent.",
        "LOUISE: And competent, they also find you, well, a tad. . .",
        "MADELINE: Scary.",
        "LOUISE: Someone thought a Halloween mask of you would sell big.",
        "PARIS: Well, fine, they don't like me. Big deal, right? I'm still most competent.",
        "LOUISE: Yes, but when asked if the likability issue would affect their voting choice, almost a hundred percent said yes.",
        "PARIS: That's crazy. You mean, people would rather vote for a moronic twink who they liked over someone who could actually do the job?",
        "LOUISE: Sad, but true.",
        "PARIS: Well, what do I do?",
        "MADELINE: Hope for a s*x scandal?",
        "PARIS: Louise?",
        "LOUISE: Oh, I'm on it.",

        "PARIS: Hey.",
        "RORY: Tomorrow with everyone else.",
        "PARIS: So, I have been wracking my brains for weeks trying to figure out exactly who should be my vice presidential candidate, you know? Who would be yin to my yang, Joel to my Ethan, Damon to my Affleck, and then suddenly, it hits me \u0096 the perfect person.",
        "RORY: Who?",
        "PARIS: You.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "PARIS: It's genius. We could announce it in the Franklin tomorrow, Gellar and Gilmore. We even have the g-thing going. Never underestimate the power of alliteration, my friend.",
        "RORY: I don't wanna be vice president.",
        "PARIS: Oh, come on. Every little girl wants to be vice president.",
        "RORY: Not this one.",
        "PARIS: But you have to. It's the only way. Please? I'm begging you.",
        "RORY: Paris.",
        "PARIS: They hate me, okay?",
        "RORY: Who hates you?",
        "PARIS: Everyone. Everyone in the whole school hates me. Oh, yeah, they think I'm the best for the job, but they don't want to go to the mall with me so they won't vote for me and that means I'm going to lose.",
        "RORY: Well, how is my running with you gonna change anything?",
        "PARIS: Because people think you're nice. You're quiet, you say excuse me, you look like little birds help you get dressed in the morning. People don't fear you.",
        "RORY: Hey, I haven't been dressed by a bird since I was two.",
        "PARIS: You will soften my image.",
        "RORY: You're crazy.",
        "PARIS: Please!",
        "RORY: No, I don't want to be in politics. I just want to write about politics.",
        "PARIS: You wouldn't have to do anything. I'll do all the work and make the speeches. You just have to sit there and be nice.",
        "RORY: No.",
        "PARIS: But \u0096",
        "RORY: Bye.",
        "PARIS: Harvard loves this kid of crap. Being vice president is just one more thing to put you ahead of the rest of the hundreds of thousands of straight\u0096A students who are applying for the same spot you are. Think about it. You say no, then comes the day when the letter from Harvard arrives. They've turned you down. Enjoy Connecticut State, sucker. Tell me you won't be thinking, what if I had just run with Paris? What if the one thing that could've ensured my place behind those ivy covered walls I just walked away from?",
        "RORY: Fine.",
        "PARIS: Yes! Okay.",
        "RORY: I guess the thought of just being nice to people never occurred to you, huh?",
        "PARIS: See, that is exactly what I need from you, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm for the new millennium. Hey, wear some braids tomorrow with bows. I mean, hell, let's sell it, sister!",

        "RORY: About getting my arm back? No.",
        "LORELAI: Really? \u0091Cause I've kind of gotten used to Casty over here. I mean, we decorated him, we talked to him, we protected him from getting wet in the shower.",
        "RORY: Okay, it's time to wean you off of getting attached to inanimate objects.",
        "LORELAI: Casty, no one understands you like I do. What? No, I did not know Mr. Band-Aid said that to you. Ugh, I will talk to him when we get home.",

Remember people, if Chilton soars, we soar. If Chilton fails, we fail. It is up to us, we must get involved, we must care. It is not enough to sign a petition to get a Little Debbie machine installed in the senior corridor. Snack cakes will not change the world. Cream filling will not decide our legacy. How will future generations of Chilton students remember the class of 2003? John F. Kennedy once said, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country. Those eloquent words are just as relevant to here in this hall today. What can you, the future of Chilton, of America, of the world, what can you do for your school? I will tell you what you can do. You can vote for me, Paris Gellar, for student body president, and let me start tomorrow for you today. Thank you."
