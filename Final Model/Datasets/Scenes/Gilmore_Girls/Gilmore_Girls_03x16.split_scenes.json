        "OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai and Rory are both reading in the living room. Lorelai glances out the window]",
        "LORELAI: Mail!",
        "RORY: Mail!",
        "LORELAI: Hurry up! Where are your shoes?",
        "RORY: I'll get them later.",
        "LORELAI: No, get them now.",
        "RORY: Why?",
        "LORELAI: Why? Because if your Harvard acceptance letter is in that batch of mail and you do not have shoes on, we can't run off immediately and celebrate. All of our happiness will be on hold until you come back inside and put on your shoes. Is that what you want to put a hold on happiness?",
        "RORY: What's the difference if we wait then or we wait now?",
        "LORELAI: Because we are not happy now.",
        "RORY: Right, okay. [runs to her bedroom]",
        "LORELAI: No laces, just get them on your feet.",
        "RORY: [runs back with shoes on] Let's go!",
        "[they run outside to the mailbox. Kirk is going through his mailbag]",
        "LORELAI: Kirk!",
        "RORY: Kirk!",
        "KIRK: Good morning, ladies.",
        "LORELAI: Is there an envelope in there?",
        "RORY: A big envelope, not a little envelope.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, a big envelope means she's in, a little envelope means she needs to marry rich.",
        "KIRK: Just one second, please.",
        "RORY: Aren't you supposed to go through the mail before you get here?",
        "KIRK: Some work that way. Personally, I think it takes the spontaneity out of the job.",
        "LORELAI: Need some help?",
        "KIRK: Sorry, federal law prohibits it.",
        "RORY: Any chance you could go faster?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, you got a girl's future in that sack of yours, Santa.",
        "RORY: Thank you for adding the Santa.",
        "LORELAI: Any time.",
        "KIRK: You know what I've noticed?",
        "LORELAI: It wouldn't be any mail in there with our names on it, would it?",
        "KIRK: I've noticed people don't slow down anymore.",
        "RORY: Guess I've got time to tie my shoes.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, well, cobble yourself a new pair Daniel Day Lewis.",
        "KIRK: No one stops to smell a nice flower or look at a puppy.",
        "LORELAI: You're absolutely right.",
        "[Kirk pulls a large envelope out of his mailbag]",
        "KIRK: No one stops to ask how you're doing. . .is your family well, did you see that game last night?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, yeah, people suck. Is that ours?",
        "KIRK: What? Oh. [checks envelope] Mrs. Rita Flora. Nope.",
        "RORY: Rats.",
        "LORELAI: It could still be in there.",
        "KIRK: Rita Flora \u0096 didn't she die?",
        "LORELAI: While you were delivering her mail?",
        "KIRK: She did die. She died last week.",
        "LORELAI: Kirk.",
        "KIRK: They're supposed to put your mail on hold when you die.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, let's go back inside.",
        "RORY: What about the envelope?",
        "LORELAI: We'll check back on our way to Luke's. . .for dinner.",
        "KIRK: [pulls out another envelope] Hey, one for Kirk.",
        "[opening credits]",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Lorelai, Rory and Lane are sitting at a table. Lane is tapping her drumsticks on a jar]",
        "LANE: It's getting frustrating. I mean, there's so many great songs that have been written post-Cobain, but try and convince Zach of that. I mean, he's impossible, stubborn, and just a tad intellectually challenged, in case you haven't noticed.",
        "LORELAI: Lane, honey?",
        "LANE: Yeah?",
        "LORELAI: Just, could you, with the sticks there, I can't. . .",
        "LANE: Oh, sorry. Nervous habit.",
        "RORY: Mom's a little crabby this morning.",
        "LORELAI: I'm not crabby, I'm very, very ill.",
        "RORY: With allergies.",
        "LORELAI: Deadly allergies.",
        "RORY: Sorry, didn't mean to minimize your condition. Should we make funeral arrangements now?",
        "LORELAI: Yes. [pulls some medicine out of her purse] But make sure you can get your money back in case this stuff works.",
        "RORY: Where did you get those?",
        "LORELAI: Found them in your room.",
        "RORY: These expired in \u009198.",
        "LORELAI: So, what, I should take four?",
        "RORY: Yes, that's exactly my point.",
        "[Luke walks over and sets some menus on the table]",
        "LUKE: Here.",
        "RORY: New menus.",
        "LANE: Very fancy.",
        "LORELAI: Why'd you get new menus?",
        "LUKE: It was time.",
        "LORELAI: But I had made little doodles with my name hidden in them on each one of the old ones just like Hirschfeld.",
        "LUKE: Sorry.",
        "LORELAI: It took me years to hit every menu. And these have super heavy plastic over them. How am I gonna doodle?",
        "LUKE: Has it ever occurred to you that the super heavy plastic is there to discourage the doodling?",
        "RORY: Hey, this looks different.",
        "LUKE: It's not different.",
        "LANE: It's totally different.",
        "LUKE: It's not that different.",
        "LORELAI: There are more salads.",
        "RORY: Three more salads.",
        "LORELAI: Three more salads \u0096 who needs three more salads?",
        "RORY: One was enough.",
        "LUKE: Well, Nicole said \u0096",
        "LORELAI: Nicole said.",
        "LUKE: There wasn't really that much for her to eat on the menu, so I just. . .",
        "LORELAI: Oh, you added three more salads just for Nicole. When I asked you to add chili-topped Pringles, you said no.",
        "LUKE: And I stand by that.",
        "LORELAI: How come Nicole gets three salads and I still get a no?",
        "RORY: Because Nicole is his girlfriend.",
        "LUKE: Nicole is not my girlfriend, Nicole is the woman that I am dating, that's it.",
        "LORELAI: So what happens when you guys get serious, the whole place goes soy?",
        "LUKE: Just order, please.",
        "LANE: Did you take off the Monte Cristo sandwich?",
        "LUKE: Well, I \u0096",
        "RORY: No!",
        "LORELAI: You did, you took off the Monte Cristo sandwich.",
        "LUKE: I omitted a few obsolete dishes.",
        "LORELAI: I can't believe Nicole made you take off the Monte Cristo. She's got you menu-whipped.",
        "LUKE: She does not have me menu-whipped. I took off a disgusting ridiculous sandwich that no one has ever ordered, including the three of you.",
        "RORY: But just having it there made us feel like we always could.",
        "LORELAI: It was comforting.",
        "RORY: Like soup.",
        "LORELAI: Exactly. It was comforting like deep-fried ham and cheese soup.",
        "RORY: And even though I never ordered it, I talked about ordering it, haven't I?",
        "LANE: On several occasions.",
        "LORELAI: So you've not only eliminated a sandwich, you've eliminated a conversation piece.",
        "RORY: Now what will we talk about?",
        "LUKE: Fine.",
        "[Luke walks to the counter and returns with some old menus]",
        "LUKE: Here. Old menus, everything's there. Knock yourselves out.",
        "LORELAI: How come everybody else gets a new menu? [Luke walks away] I feel much better now.",
        "CUT TO CHILTON CLASSROOM",
        "[A teacher is passing back papers]",
        "TEACHER: Well, I must say I'm glad to see that simply because the SATs are over, most of you are still taking your classwork seriously. Most of you.",
        "LOUISE: Michael Mason. Worth every wrong answer.",
        "TEACHER: All right, before we continue, I would like to remind you that the Chilton Bicentennial celebration takes place next week.",
        "LOUISE: Number four. [shows off her hickey]",
        "MADELINE: Well done.",
        "TEACHER: The official sign up sheet for the speech contest has gone up in the back of the room. The contest will be held on Friday, and the winner will present their speech at the ceremony next week. Now, some of you may be saying to yourself, \u0091Hey, I already turned in my college application. Why should I spend all this time entering a speech competition, which if I win means I have to give up a Friday night, when I can't even use it for my resume? What's in it for me?'",
        "MADELINE: Wow, that was spooky.",
        "TEACHER: Yes, the speech will not go on your record. However, the bicentennial is going to be quite a prestigious affair. Past alumni and faculty will be there, some of these people are now professors at the same schools you're planning an attending. Plus, C-SPAN will be broadcasting the event live. All in all, it's shaping up to be a very exciting event. Think about it. [bell rings] Oh, I almost forgot to welcome back Brad Langford. He returns to us fresh from Broadway where he's just completed a successful run of Into the Woods. Welcome back, Brad.",
        "BRAD: Thank you. It's good to be back.",
        "PARIS: Sit down, Mary Martin.",
        "TEACHER: All right everyone, have a lovely rest of the day. I will see you tomorrow.",
        "[the students start to leave. Brad walks up to Rory]",
        "BRAD: Rory, hi.",
        "RORY: Hey Brad, good to have you back. How was Broadway?",
        "BRAD: It was great, but Nathan Lane is a very bitter man.",
        "RORY: I've heard that.",
        "BRAD: You know, I tell you, even more than the actual experience of performing live, the confidence it gives you in every aspect of your life, that's the most amazing thing.",
        "RORY: Well, you do look rather confident.",
        "BRAD: Hey, it's the new me.",
        "[Madeline and Louise walk over]",
        "LOUISE: So, Brad. . .Broadway, I must know.",
        "BRAD: Yes?",
        "LOUISE: Did you get to keep your makeup?",
        "MADELINE: What about your costumes, \u0091cause that seems great.",
        "LOUISE: Ooh, unless you're doing Les Mis.",
        "MADELINE: Or Cats.",
        "LOUISE: Furry spandex with a tail and jazz shoes?",
        "MADELINE: Hurrah. So, do you?",
        "BRAD: Do I?",
        "MADELINE: Get to keep the makeup?",
        "BRAD: I didn't ask.",
        "LOUISE: You didn't ask?",
        "MADELINE: How do you leave the house every morning and not have a piano fall on your head?",
        "BRAD: Well, I make a left on Federal and then \u0096",
        "RORY: Brad, that really didn't require an answer.",
        "[Paris walks over]",
        "PARIS: You're blocking the list.",
        "RORY: What's that? Will we please move so you may sign up for the speech contest? Why, yes, Paris, we'd be happy to. How kind of you to phrase it in that very respectful manner.",
        "PARIS: Are you going to move, or do you need a five, six, seven, eight?",
        "BRAD: Paris, this time on stage has been a very growing experience for me. I'm no longer intimidated by you or people like you.",
        "PARIS: I'm thrilled to hear it, Chita Rivera. Move. Well, Gilmore, I certainly hope you're signing up, too. It'll be my last chance to trounce you with anything at this school.",
        "RORY: My decision to do this will in no way depend on you, Paris.",
        "PARIS: I'm only saying it won't be a totally satisfying victory just beating Jerome Robbins and the rest of the losers here. I'd really like to take you down also.",
        "BRAD: Boy, she is really up on her theater references.",
        "CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN",
        "[Sookie, surrounded by her kitchen staff, has several plates of food on the counter in front of her]",
        "SOOKIE: This is outrageous. I am beyond offended. Did you tell them I'm beyond offended? Sending my food back? That's it, get their names, they're never eating here again.",
        "WAITER: Okay.",
        "SOOKIE: Wait, what wine was he drinking?",
        "WAITER: 1952 Chateau Petrus Bordeaux.",
        "SOOKIE: Hm. Okay, never mind.",
        "[Lorelai walks in]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, is everything okay?",
        "SOOKIE: No, we have got to have a better screening system for customers here.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, we do, since we currently have no screening system for customers here.",
        "SOOKIE: They sent it back. My food. My four star, \u0091you haven't lived \u0091til you've eaten there, says Ruth Reichl,' food.",
        "LORELAI: What did they say was wrong?",
        "SOOKIE: You name it. Too salty, too hot, too sewer-y.",
        "LORELAI: Honey, calm down. Some people are just stupid.",
        "SOOKIE: Yes, they are stupid, and stupid people have stupid friends, and they all have to come here and be stupid together.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, now, don't be mad at me, but I have to ask this \u0096 are you sure there's nothing wrong with the food?",
        "SOOKIE: Of course there's nothing wrong with the food. You don't think that I would know if something was wrong with my food? You don't think that I tasted every last dish that was sent back. I tasted it, Manuel tasted it, Rico tasted it, Louella tasted it. We all tasted it and it tastes fine.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. Do you mind?",
        "SOOKIE: You don't believe me?",
        "LORELAI: I believe you completely, but it's easier for me to take on those who doubt you if I actually tasted it myself.",
        "SOOKIE: Fine, go ahead.",
        "[Lorelai tries the food]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, now I get the sewer-y reference.",
        "SOOKIE: What are you talking about?",
        "LORELAI: Come here. [to waiter] Just, uh, send them out some free desserts.",
        "SOOKIE: Free desserts? You're giving the stupid people free desserts.",
        "LORELAI: Sookie, I love you.",
        "SOOKIE: I love you, too.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, and I love your food, you know that.",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah.",
        "LORELAI: But I have to tell you that that bite I just had over there is one of the worst things I've ever tasted, and I've tasted some very bad things.",
        "SOOKIE: What?",
        "LORELAI: Are you sure you didn't just accidentally drop something in the food tonight, like, I don't know, uh, strychnine or manure?",
        "SOOKIE: No, I tested each dish every step of the way. I mean, the base, the stock, the sauce, the seasonings.",
        "LORELAI: Are you sick? \u0091Cause sometimes the flu or a cold or even allergies can throw your tastebuds off.",
        "SOOKIE: No, I'm not sick. I mean, I had a little bug last week, but nothing today.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I think you should think about getting a checkup. Maybe it was more than a little bug.",
        "SOOKIE: The food was really bad?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, honey, it was just. . .well, yeah, it was really that bad.",
        "SOOKIE: I don't understand it.",
        "LORELAI: Ah, I'm sure it was nothing. Just have Manuel help you with the tasting for the rest of the night, okay?",
        "[Rory walks into the kitchen]",
        "RORY: Paris is going to drive me completely insane. Ooh, that looks good.",
        "ENTIRE KITCHEN STAFF: No!",
        "RORY: Geez.",
        "LORELAI: Be happy you're loved, hon. I got a Kit Kat in my purse.",
        "[Lorelai and Rory walk into the lobby]",
        "RORY: What's up?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. It's weird, Sookie must be sick or something.",
        "RORY: Sookie never gets sick.",
        "LORELAI: She'll be fine. So, tell me, what did Paris do now?",
        "RORY: It's nothing, it's just Paris. There's this speech contest for the bicentennial, and I wasn't even going to enter it, but I don't know \u0096 with the whole \u0091it's my last chance to crush you before graduation' comment, I want to enter, I want to win, and I wanna dance around her saying \u0091I win, I win, I win!'",
        "LORELAI: Wow, you're getting more and more like me everyday.",
        "RORY: But I know, it was petty and stupid and I should probably just ignore her.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, that is what you should do.",
        "RORY: Okay, that is what I will do.",
        "LORELAI: How come you weren't gonna enter the contest?",
        "RORY: I don't know.",
        "LORELAI: You love doing school things.",
        "RORY: I don't love doing school things when it involves the entire school staring at me while I'm doing them.",
        "LORELAI: You had to give your vice presidential acceptance speech in front of the entire school.",
        "RORY: Yeah, but I had to do that.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, so you're just gonna go through life only doing what you have to do.",
        "RORY: Well, no.",
        "LORELAI: Because a person who wants to be a foreign correspondent for a living should probably embrace the opportunity to practice her speechin' skills in front of a crowd.",
        "RORY: You had the motherly edge going there until you threw in the speechin' skills comment.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, well, you know what I mean.",
        "RORY: I know what you mean. Okay, I'll go out for the speech.",
        "LORELAI: Good.",
        "RORY: And if I get to do the \u0091I win, I win, I win' dance, then so much the better.",
        "LORELAI: For everyone involved.",
        "RORY: Mmhmm.",
        "LORELAI: Oh my God. Oh my God.",
        "[Lorelai walks across the lobby. Sookie is walking toward her]",
        "LORELAI: You're pregnant!",
        "SOOKIE: I'm pregnant!",
        "[they scream and jump up and down]",
        "SOOKIE: Oh my God, I'm pregnant!",
        "RORY: You're pregnant?",
        "SOOKIE: I'm pregnant!",
        "LORELAI: That's why!",
        "SOOKIE: I'm pregnant!",
        "RORY: That's great!",
        "[they all scream and hug]",
        "CUT TO CHILTON HALLWAY",
        "[Students are outside a classroom awaiting their turns in the speech contest. Paris walks up to a girl and looks at her speech]",
        "PARIS: Huh.",
        "GIRL: What?",
        "PARIS: That just looks like more than four thousand words, but I'm sure you counted them.",
        "GIRL: I did.",
        "PARIS: Good. [to another girl] Hey Shelly, good luck. Although I'm sure you're going to be great. After all, there's hardly anything on stage for you to trip over this time, right? [sits down next to Brad; sings] I've got my beans at Grandma's house, my magic beans at Grandma's house.",
        "BRAD: Stop it.",
        "PARIS: [sings] I'll take my beans, my magic beans, who's got the beans, we need some beans, I love the beans.",
        "BRAD: You can't rattle me.",
        "PARIS: [sings] Into the woods at Grandma's house.",
        "BRAD: Look, I'm proud of my part, okay? The New York Times called me winningly na\u00efve.",
        "PARIS: [sings] Into the woods, into the woods, into the woods.",
        "RORY: Stop it right now.",
        "PARIS: I know, that is one annoying song.",
        "RORY: Leave Brad alone, and stop terrorizing everyone in this hallway.",
        "PARIS: Terrorizing? What are you talking about, terrorizing? I'm simply talking to my fellow classmates.",
        "RORY: You're trying to scare them into doing badly so you'll win easier.",
        "PARIS: I am not.",
        "RORY: Oh really? And that magical bean recital back there?",
        "PARIS: Hey, I was trying to give the kid some human contact. He's been talking to nothing but a cow for a year and a half.",
        "BRAD: There was a person inside that cow, I've told you that!",
        "TEACHER: [walks out of classroom] Brad Langford.",
        "BRAD: I'm winningly na\u00efve.",
        "TEACHER: Okay.",
        "PARIS: Brad, you got your beans?",
        "RORY: Stop. Go Brad, you'll do great.",
        "[Brad walks into the classroom]",
        "RORY: It's amazing how you manage to hide those bolts on the side of your neck. What is that, just really good cover up?",
        "PARIS: Rory, lower your voice. People are trying to concentrate.",
        "RORY: Wow.",
        "PARIS: Wow what?",
        "RORY: Your speech must really suck.",
        "PARIS: Excuse me?",
        "RORY: I mean, if you're going to all this trouble to psych out everyone else, then you must know you have a loser there.",
        "PARIS: Mind games. Not your forte, cupcake. Stick to talking to losers off the train tracks, will you?",
        "RORY: You're horrible.",
        "PARIS: And I'm going to win. [a girl sits next to her] Cherry, hi. Man those braces are shiny.",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT YARD",
        "[Lorelai walks out of the house toward the Jeep; her cell phone rings]",
        "LORELAI: [answers phone] Hello",
        "SOOKIE: It's me.",
        "LORELAI: Every detail, leave nothing out.",
        "SOOKIE: Well, I told him.",
        "LORELAI: Did he flip? Did he cry? Did he scream?",
        "SOOKIE: No.",
        "LORELAI: No? Did he hear you?",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah, he heard me.",
        "LORELAI: I don't understand, what happened?",
        "SOOKIE: Well, I came home and I got some flowers and I chilled some glasses and I put some music on and I opened a bottle of champagne, and the cork broke the window so I had to clean up the glass, and then I taped some cardboard over the hole, and then I knocked over the bottle of champagne, so I had to get out the mop.",
