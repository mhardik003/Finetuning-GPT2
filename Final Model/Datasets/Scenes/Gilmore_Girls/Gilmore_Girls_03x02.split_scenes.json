        "[Lorelai, Rory, and Emily are sitting in the living room]",
        "RORY: Well, this is nice, isn't it? [pause] So, Grandma, Grandpa is traveling again, huh?",
        "EMILY: Yes, he is.",
        "RORY: Business must be good.",
        "EMILY: Seems to be.",
        "RORY: That's great. Isn't that great, Mom?",
        "LORELAI: A jig is forthcoming.",
        "RORY: Mom's business is great, too. I mean, not that it's without its problem, you know, but they're usually funny problems. . .like, um. . .oh! Mom, why don't you tell Grandma about the mouse?",
        "EMILY: What mouse?",
        "RORY: Mom?",
        "LORELAI: There's a mouse at the inn.",
        "EMILY: Is the place dirty?",
        "LORELAI: No, it's just surrounded by this thing called nature and. . .mice happen.",
        "EMILY: Mice carry diseases, you know.",
        "LORELAI: It's a tiny little field mouse, Mom.",
        "EMILY: I don't care how big it is, it's still a rodent.",
        "LORELAI: Let's just change the subject, shall we?",
        "EMILY: You should set a trap.",
        "LORELAI: Got it covered.",
        "EMILY: Just make sure you don't use poison.",
        "LORELAI: Got it covered.",
        "EMILY: They will eat the poison and then go into the walls and die, decompose, and the entire place will smell.",
        "LORELAI: I've got it covered, but thanks.",
        "EMILY: I just have to say, I don't know why you're the one sitting here with an attitude. I'm the one who should be mad.",
        "LORELAI: Let's not do this, okay Mom?",
        "EMILY: After all, you're the one who just walked out of here last week without saying a word.",
        "LORELAI: Because I couldn't get a word in.",
        "EMILY: Your father and I were shocked and upset.",
        "LORELAI: So what else is new?",
        "EMILY: You didn't give us five minutes to digest the news.",
        "LORELAI: Please, find the off switch.",
        "EMILY: You simply dumped it on us and walked out. I hardly think that's fair.",
        "LORELAI: Mom, it doesn't matter. It's over. Let's just move on, okay? We came here to have a nice evening, so. . .come on, let's have it. [picks up the newspaper from the coffee table]",
        "RORY: Something smells good.",
        "EMILY: Braised lamb shank.",
        "RORY: Oh, braised lamb shank! I love a lamb shank when it is braised.",
        "LORELAI: Oh my God.",
        "EMILY: Reading in front of other people is extremely rude, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Shauna Christy shot her husband.",
        "EMILY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Shauna Christy, you remember Shauna Christy.",
        "EMILY: Yes, I remember Shauna Christy, she was a lovely girl.",
        "LORELAI: Well, apparently this lovely girl came home to find her husband giving the nanny a nice little bonus package. And they say good help is hard to find.",
        "EMILY: That's just gossip.",
        "LORELAI: Gossip? The man was shot thirty-five times. He looks like a sprinkler system.",
        "EMILY: I can't believe this. Shauna was always such a nice girl. She was bright, cultured, well-spoken.",
        "LORELAI: And apparently a big Annie Oakley fan.",
        "EMILY: This is not funny, the woman committed a crime.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, fine.",
        "EMILY: This is a tragedy.",
        "LORELAI: My bad, sorry.",
        "EMILY: A man is dead, a young woman ruined.",
        "LORELAI: Consider the subject dropped.",
        "EMILY: At least she had a husband to kill.",
        "LORELAI: This is nice, isn't it?",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table; Lorelai sneezes]",
        "RORY: Bless you.",
        "LORELAI: Thank you. Ugh, I hate having a cold.",
        "RORY: I know you do.",
        "LORELAI: Ugh, it's bad enough being sick, but anybody can have a cold.",
        "RORY: I know they can.",
        "LORELAI: I mean, I'd like to have a good illness, something different, impressive. Just once I'd like to be able to say, \"Yeah, I'm not feeling so good, my leg is haunted.\"",
        "RORY: See, there's a reason why you only take one packet of TheraFlu at a time.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "[Luke brings their food]",
        "LUKE: All right, pancakes, one fried egg, side of bacon. Chicken noodle soup, side of mashed potatoes.",
        "RORY: Thanks, Luke.",
        "LORELAI: Thanks.",
        "LUKE: How's the cold coming?",
        "LORELAI: It's fine.",
        "LUKE: Any better?",
        "LORELAI: It's fine.",
        "LUKE: It's the third day in a row you've ordered soup for breakfast.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, thanks for the tally.",
        "LUKE: You know what helps get rid of a cold?",
        "LORELAI: Endless vague questioning first thing in the morning?",
        "LUKE: A healthy immune system.",
        "LORELAI: My second guess.",
        "LUKE: And you know how you get a healthy immune system?",
        "LORELAI: Remember when you hated me? That was fun, wasn't it?",
        "LUKE: Is it eating nothing but crap all day and blowing out your brain cells with coffee?",
        "RORY: No.",
        "LUKE: That's right, no.",
        "LORELAI: Why are you helping him?",
        "RORY: No seemed like the right answer.",
        "LUKE: Eat a vegetable now and then, maybe some high fiber cereal in the morning.",
        "LORELAI: Listen, Grandpa, my soup's getting cold.",
        "LUKE: At least eat the carrots in the soup this time, not just the noodles.",
        "LORELAI: I promise.",
        "[Luke walks away; Lorelai holds her bowl of soup toward Rory]",
        "LORELAI: Eat my carrots.",
        "RORY: Apparently, maturity is extremely overrated in your universe.",
        "LORELAI: That's right. The Empress Bobo Belle forbids it. Eat.",
        "[Jess' girlfriend Shane walks up to Jess at the counter]",
        "SHANE: Hey.",
        "JESS: Hey.",
        "[they kiss]",
        "SHANE: So?",
        "JESS: One sec.",
        "SHANE: Jess.",
        "JESS: Relax. I'm out. Let's go.",
        "SHANE: Okay.",
        "[they leave]",
        "LORELAI: Ladies and gentlemen, an entire conversation in ten words or less.",
        "RORY: A true meeting of the minds.",
        "[Dean walks up to their table]",
        "DEAN: Okay, so, uh, please don't hate me, but I already ate breakfast.",
        "RORY: See, nice full sentences.",
        "DEAN: What?",
        "LORELAI: Don't ruin it.",
        "CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN",
        "[Lorelai and Michel are looking into the fireplace]",
        "LORELAI: You're sure?",
        "MICHEL: Positive. It ran right across the lobby and into the fireplace.",
        "LORELAI: I don't see it.",
        "MICHEL: Well, it must've found a hole to crawl into.",
        "LORELAI: We cannot have this mouse running around the inn. Customers will freak.",
        "MICHEL: Well, tell them it's a baby. People love babies. They'll talk to it in funny voices.",
        "LORELAI: Did you call an exterminator?",
        "MICHEL: Why, no, what a wonderful idea. I was actually going to fasten a large wedge of cheese to my head and lay on the ground until Mickey gets hungry and decides to crawl out and snack on my face.",
        "LORELAI: When does he get here?",
        "MICHEL: He said we were the first stop.",
        "LORELAI: What do we do until them?",
        "MICHEL: Make cat sounds?",
        "[Kirk walks into the inn carrying a package]",
        "KIRK: Excuse me, Lorelai?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, hey Kirk. Hold on a sec. [to Michel] Just stand here and make sure it doesn't come out.",
        "MICHEL: Oh, goody, a promotion.",
        "LORELAI: [walks over to Kirk] Hi Kirk. What can I do for ya?",
        "KIRK: I have a delivery for Sookie.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, well, anything good?",
        "KIRK: No, just some wedding photos.",
        "LORELAI: Great. Well, she stepped out for a minute, but I'll take them to her. I swear, I'll give them to her. If you want, I'll leave and find her and then I'll give them to her.",
        "KIRK: No, that won't be necessary.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, well. . .",
        "KIRK: Uh, Lorelai, can I speak to you for a moment?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, sure.",
        "KIRK: Could we sit?",
        "LORELAI: Sit. . .sure, let's sit. [they sit down on the sofa] Is everything okay?",
        "KIRK: Okay?",
        "LORELAI: Yes.",
        "KIRK: With me?",
        "LORELAI: Yes.",
        "KIRK: Well, my mother has developed a condition \u0096 makes her knees enormous. Yesterday I spent all morning cutting holes in her pants so she could sit, but other than that and the dyspeptic parrot problem, everything is fine.",
        "LORELAI: Well, good, I'm glad. Okay, well, um, I'm gonna \u0096",
        "KIRK: I was just wondering . . .",
        "LORELAI: Yes. . .wondering what?",
        "KIRK: We've known each other for a good amount of time now. Our, uh, paths have crossed professionally and socially a number of times, all with relatively pleasant results, and well, I was just wondering if you would like to have dinner with me?",
        "LORELAI: Oh.",
        "KIRK: In two weeks.",
        "LORELAI: Two weeks?",
        "KIRK: I heard you have a cold. I think two weeks is enough time to ensure the virus is out of your system.",
        "LORELAI: Well, Kirk, I \u0096",
        "KIRK: You don't have to answer me right away. I know that this is completely out of the blue for you. Take a few days and think about it. [starts walking toward the door]",
        "LORELAI: Kirk, wait.",
        "KIRK: By the way, I think you might be the prettiest girl I've ever seen. . .outside of a really filthy magazine.",
        "LORELAI: Thank you.",
        "[Kirk leaves; Lorelai walks past Michel]",
        "LORELAI: Don't.",
        "MICHEL: I am doing nothing. Ben, however, has dropped dead from laughter.",
        "CUT TO RORY'S BEDROOM",
        "[Rory wakes up and sees Lorelai sitting in a chair staring at her]",
        "RORY: How long have you been sitting there?",
        "LORELAI: Not long. An hour. . .and a half.",
        "RORY: Why?",
        "LORELAI: Because.",
        "RORY: \u0091Cause why?",
        "LORELAI: Because today is the last first day of high school you're ever gonna have.",
        "RORY: You're insane.",
        "LORELAI: I'm not insane, I'm just sentimental, and you're grown.",
        "RORY: I'm not grown.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, you are, you're all grown up and soon you'll be going off into the world.",
        "RORY: Not yet.",
        "LORELAI: But soon. And after you spread those wings and fly away, I won't have the opportunity to give you this.",
        "[Lorelai hands her a piece of paper]",
        "RORY: What is it?",
        "LORELAI: It's your bill.",
        "RORY: My what?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. I've been crunching the numbers, you know, adding up what you've cost me over the years \u0096 raising you, clothing you, feeding you, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.",
        "RORY: Mmhmm.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I've itemized everything here by years and income ratio. I thought you could factor it into your student loan.",
        "RORY: Oh boy.",
        "LORELAI: One thing that's painfully obvious here \u0096 you've used an extraordinary number of diapers.",
        "RORY: I'm gonna go take a shower.",
        "LORELAI: Really, it's cost a fortune. What were you using all those diapers for?",
        "RORY: I was building my \u0091make Mommy go away' castle.",
        "LORELAI: All right, you got home too late last night and I didn't get a chance to talk to you.",
        "RORY: I got home at ten and you were already asleep.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I was trying to watch The Legend of Bagger Vance again.",
        "RORY: Okay, what did I miss?",
        "LORELAI: Okay. Kirk asked me out.",
        "RORY: Shut up!",
        "LORELAI: Yesterday he came to the inn and asked me to dinner.",
        "RORY: That's so sweet.",
        "LORELAI: Sweet?",
        "RORY: You should wear your dress with the ponies on it. I bet he likes ponies.",
        "LORELAI: Rory, I cannot go out with Kirk.",
        "RORY: Why?",
        "LORELAI: Uh huh. . .why? He's. . .he's Kirk!",
        "RORY: Well, as long as he loves you.",
        "LORELAI: You are not serious.",
        "RORY: I just want you to be happy.",
        "LORELAI: \"Hello Headmaster Charleston, this is my stepfather Kirk. Please don't make any sudden movements, he's a fear biter.\"",
        "RORY: Okay, so how will you let him down?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. That's why I needed to talk to you, you're the nice one in the family.",
        "RORY: Well, you could just tell him the truth. You could tell him that you're not interested in dating him and that you just wanna be friends.",
        "LORELAI: That sounds so lame.",
        "RORY: You could tell him you're involved with someone.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, because my current karma is so great in that area, I can really afford to jinx it with that kind of lie \u0096 no!",
        "RORY: Okay, then you figure it out.",
        "LORELAI: All right. . .we're gonna have to move.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: Take off in the middle of the night, leave everything behind, assume different identities. I'll join a local community theater and I'll drive you to soccer. It'll work for many years until the FBI comes to get me, and by that time, you're on your own.",
        "RORY: I don't play soccer.",
        "LORELAI: You do now.",
        "[they walk into the kitchen; as they start getting out stuff for breakfast, Rory laughs.]",
        "LORELAI: Stop!",
        "RORY: It's funny.",
        "LORELAI: It's not funny, it's bad! I have to see this guy. He works at every business in town, I can't get away from him!",
        "RORY: Well, then you should marry him and move in with his mother.",
        "LORELAI: I'll handle it myself, thank you very much.",
        "RORY: Sorry, just trying to help.",
        "LORELAI: So you have your swearing in ceremony today.",
        "RORY: At three, do not be late.",
        "LORELAI: I will not be late.",
        "RORY: Okay, I have something to tell you.",
        "LORELAI: Is it about Vince Foster?",
        "RORY: It's about Grandma.",
        "LORELAI: Oops.",
        "RORY: She's coming today.",
        "LORELAI: No!",
        "RORY: Mom, I'm sorry. She found out about it, she called. . .",
        "LORELAI: And you said yes?",
        "RORY: She's my grandmother.",
        "LORELAI: So?",
        "RORY: So what am I supposed to say?",
        "LORELAI: Say \"Sorry, Grandma, but if my mother sees you, she'll run screaming down the hall.\"",
        "RORY: You'll be sitting there listening to the ceremony, you hardly have to talk at all.",
        "LORELAI: Rory.",
        "RORY: Hey, we are family.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, well, look how great that worked out for Sister Sledge.",
        "RORY: I'm gonna go take a shower. You'll be pouting out here when I'm done?",
        "LORELAI: No, I gotta go to work. I'll see you this afternoon.",
        "RORY: At three.",
        "LORELAI: There goes my little vice president, off to rule the world.",
        "RORY: Well, Paris will be ruling the world. I will be holding her keys.",
        "LORELAI: I'm still proud of you.",
        "RORY: I appreciate it.",
        "LORELAI: Honey, you have power, brains, now all you need is a dimwitted, drunken or drug-addicted relative to constantly humiliate you while you serve in office.",
        "RORY: Will you work on that for me?",
        "LORELAI: Two steps ahead of you.",
        "CUT TO CHILTON",
        "[Rory is standing in the hallway as Lorelai runs up to her]",
        "LORELAI: Ah, time?",
        "RORY: 3:01.",
        "LORELAI: No, oh man, not fair, stupid traffic lights!",
        "RORY: That's okay, it doesn't start \u0091til 3:15.",
        "LORELAI: But I so tried to . . . you lied to me.",
        "RORY: Did I?",
        "LORELAI: You said it was at three, and it's at three-fifteen.",
        "RORY: Well, I guess I did.",
        "LORELAI: Ah! That's it, I'm standing up in the middle of your speech and demanding a recount.",
        "RORY: Shall we seat you?",
        "LORELAI: Betrayed, lied to and humiliated.",
        "[they walk into the auditorium]",
        "RORY: Well, get used to it \u0096 I am in politics now.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, where's, uh. . .",
        "RORY: She's not here yet.",
        "LORELAI: You told her the real time, didn't you?",
        "RORY: Well, Grandma can handle structure. How's this?",
        "LORELAI: Fine.",
        "RORY: Okay, great. You can sit there and you can put your purse on that chair to save it for Grandma.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yeah, great idea.",
        "RORY: Mom.",
        "LORELAI: Fine, yeah, saving the seat. [sits down and puts her purse on the chair next to her] There, all saved.",
        "RORY: Thank you. Now, I'll meet right outside afterwards, okay?",
        "LORELAI: Okay. I just want you to remember three things while you're sitting up there: I love you, you're the greatest kid in the world, and you're in a skirt, keep your knees closed.",
        "RORY: Bye.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, this is good advice. When I was in school, Linda Lee was class treasurer and she could not keep her knees closed if they were magnetized. Hanes should've given her an endorsement deal.",
        "[Rory walks away; Lorelai takes her purse off the seat next to her and holds it on her lap...then puts it back on the chair...then picks it back up again. She's about to put it back on the chair when Emily walks up]",
        "EMILY: Lorelai!",
        "LORELAI: Hi Mom.",
        "EMILY: [sits down] You could've put your handbag there to save my seat, you know.",
        "[cut to Headmaster Charleston at the podium on stage]",
        "HEADMASTER: Ladies and Gentlemen, I welcome you. Assemblies like this are always happy ones for me, initiating in a new group of school leaders. Chilton's always prided itself on the quality of its student government, and this year we may have outdone ourselves. These young men and women up on this stage represent the best and the brightest of what this school has to offer. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to present to you your student body government of 2003. [applause]",
        "[cut to later in the ceremony]",
        "RORY: [at podium] . . .a larger awareness of the world around us. Problems that not only face us here at school but will face us when we leave school, and more importantly, will face the next generation that follows us. We must learn that our actions have consequences, that someone else will have to clean up our mess. We need to figure out how to make that mess a little smaller. If a small fraction of these things can be accomplished this year, then I will feel like our administration has done its job. Thank you. [applause]",
        "[cut to later in the ceremony]",
        "PARIS: [at podium] In the past, all great empires have fallen. The feeling seems to be that it's inevitable \u0096 that something like what the Romans built could not last. Maybe they're right. Maybe there is no way of keeping something that big and prosperous permanently. Maybe there is no way of keeping our legacy from becoming obsolete. Well, I intend to fly in the face of such thinking, and damn it, I will succeed. I certainly don't wanna come back here twenty years from now on Alumni's Night and find this place turned into a high priced charm school, pink and white with big cheerleading megaphones painted on the walls. I wouldn't be able to take it. I would have to dismantle the place stone by stone with my bare hands. . .",
        "[cut to later in the ceremony]",
        "ALL STUDENTS ON STAGE: I have faith in the Chilton Handbook, so let it be forever.",

        "EMILY: Is Rory coming out?",
        "LORELAI: That's what she said. It was a nice ceremony.",
        "EMILY: Yes, it was.",
        "LORELAI: Long.",
        "EMILY: Very long.",

        "LORELAI: Yeah, good job with the knees.",
        "RORY: Thank you. I'm gonna run to my locker and get my backpack, then we can go.",

But this year \u0096 everything changes, starting with the library. It's completely out of proportion with its subjects. I mean, there's five hundred volumes on the French Revolution, yet only three on the Crusades. How do they expect us to get a decent education with inferior resources like that? Huh, seems like the hour's almost up. Okay, well, I think this has been an extremely successful first gathering. I appreciate all the class presidents coming and being on time.
