While completing her community service hours, Rory takes a job at Emily's Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) office. Convinced that she has a rival for the job of DAR president, Emily uses Rory as her spy. Logan returns from Europe and returns to Yale, forcing Rory to confront her true feelings about dropping out of college. Lane and her band return from their summer on the road. Luke agrees to take care of Lorelai's dog, Paul Anka, while she works late at the inn, and ends up rushing the dog to the vet.

        "(OPEN in Lorelai's living room, morning. Lorelai is sleeping and PA is lying on the floor near by. Lorelai wakes up and get's out of bed)",
        "LORELAI: (to PA) Hi! Lets get us a little breakfast. Come on. Come, Paul Anka.",
        "(CUT to Lorelai's kitchen, continuous. PA enters the kitchen and sits on a chair. Lorelai follows him and proceeds to prep up what seems to be a breakfast bouffe)",
        "(CUT to outside of Lorelai's house, continuous. The construction crew is working on the house while Lorelai walks out on the porch)",
        "LORELAI: (to workers) Breakfast! Get it while it's room temperature and nutrient-free!",
        "(CUT to Lorelai's kitchen, continuous. The crew is crammed in the kitchen helping themselves to breakfast)",
        "LORELAI: Milk, cream, and sugar's on the table. Flo's got coffee. Who needs a jolt?",
        "WORKER1: I do.",
        "LORELAI: OK. (pours him coffee) Inspect the bagels closely, because the expiration date was in Braille, apparently, and either they're new or from my baby shower. I'm also sorry to report that we are currently out of the brown sugar cinnamon pop-tarts..(hold up the pop-tart bag)",
        "WORKERS: (disappointed) Ohh!",
        "LORELAI: Huh! Don't \"ohh!\" me. You guys've been playing favourites all week and now it's time to pay the piper. So someone be a man, suck it up and start eating the shredded wheat. (puts the new box of pop tarts on the table)",
        "WORKERS: (they groan) Ah...come on...",
        "LORELAI: Cowards. (a worker extends his watch hand to pet PA who's still sitting on the chair, Lorelai stops him) Oh, hey, ooh! Remember, people, only pet the dog with your non-watch hand. In case you don't remember: Watches cause him to freak out, jump up on the counter, and kick my once-working toaster across the room.",
        "LUKE: (entering the kitchen holding a big box from Luke's) Your muffins.",
        "LORELAI: My...what?",
        "LUKE: You left me an urgent message about needing muffins.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Right! (to workers) Muffins, boys!",
        "LUKE: These were for them?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no. They were for me. I thought I'd try to eat my weight in muffins today.",
        "LUKE: Does the dog have to sit in the chair like that?",
        "LORELAI: Like what? His posture's perfect.",
        "LUKE: Chairs are for people.",
        "LORELAI: Not that chair. That's Paul Anka's chair.",
        "LUKE: Dogs are filthy. They have fleas and malaria on them. You shouldn't have fleas and malaria in the room that you're gonna eat in.",
        "LORELAI: I don't eat in here, (pointing to the workers) they do.",
        "LUKE: (to workers) Enjoying your free breakfast there, fellas? Nice free coffee there, Craig. Nice free muffin there, Benny.",
        "LORELAI: Gee, Luke. I don't think they know what you're getting at.",
        "LUKE: OK. That?s good. You done here? Cause Tom wants to talk to us.",
        "(CUT to outside of Lorelai's house, continuous. Luke and Lorelai walk on the porch. TJ is walking amongst the workers bossing them around. Tom is also around)",
        "TJ: All right, Norman. I'm gonna need you to find me some cripple studs for that bearing wall we're putting in.",
        "Cause once that sucker's vertical, we got to be ready to nail in those joists.",
        "TOM: Just keep doing what you're doing there, and then bring those tools up to Chick.",
        "TJ: So, Steve, later today we're gonna need to dig a footing drain all around the perimeter about 5 feet deep. That ought to keep the basement dry. Hey Jim...(walks away)",
        "STEVE: (to Tom) This house doesn't have a basement.",
        "TOM: No, it certainly does not.(Tom approaches Luke and Lorelai who are standing on the porch)",
        "LUKE: OK! This is ridiculous. How long are you gonna let TJ think that he's the contractor?",
        "LORELAI: To the very end, my friend.",
        "LUKE: This is stupid. We have to tell him the truth.",
        "LORELAI: No, look how happy he is strutting around in his tool belt and shiny silver helmet. You know he polishes that thing every night after work?",
        "LUKE: Really?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, really! With real silver polish. That's what he thinks silver polish is for: to polish anything that's silver. I think that's adorable.",
        "TOM: And the good news is, he's got terrible instincts. But he combines that with absolutely zero follow-through, so it all works out in the end.",
        "LORELAI: (to Luke) Huh? Terrible instincts, zero follow-through... all the qualities you want in a good pretend contractor.",
        "LUKE: But we're paying TJ a contractor's salary to do a job that he's not actually doing. And you're paying Tom an extra 10% to pretend he's not doing a job that TJ thinks he's doing but Tom is actually doing. You should hire Blake Edwards as your contractor.",
        "TOM: Oh, no! TJ'S playing with the circular saw. (runs towards TJ)",
        "LUKE: (mumbling) Oh, man...",
        "LORELAI: What!...Tom will get to him before he even finds the \"on\" switch.",
        "LUKE: We're going to tell him.",
        "LORELAI: Luke, he is your brother-in-law.",
        "LUKE: Just because Liz married him.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, but this makes him happy. Which makes Liz happy, which will make you happy, which will make me happy.",
        "LUKE: Well, just so you know, I'm gonna oversee this entire thing. OK? I'm gonna make sure TJ doesn't blow the house up.",
        "LORELAI: And I appreciate that. Now will you please go make the guys an extra pot of coffee? I'm gonna go to Babette's and take a shower.",
        "LUKE: Why? Your shower's working.",
        "LORELAI: oh..well..yeah...we just had a little incident in here yesterday.",
        "LUKE: What kind of an incident?",
        "LORELAI: Nothing big. Some of the guys saw me naked.",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: It's no big thing.",
        "LUKE: How in hell did a couple of guys see you naked?",
        "LORELAI: Well I was getting out of the shower, and Joe...",
        "LUKE: Joe? Joe saw you naked?",
        "LORELAI: And Pete.",
        "LUKE: Pete!",
        "LORELAI: Well Pete was with Joe, and then Slim...",
        "LUKE: Slim saw you naked?!",
        "LORELAI: Well I could see him, so I assume he could see me. Billy had the best view, just a straight shot right down main street.",
        "LUKE: So four guys saw you naked?",
        "LORELAI: Well if you don't count Teddy, then yes!",
        "LUKE: What in the hell were those guys doing up there in the first place?",
        "LORELAI: TJ accidentally sent them up.",
        "LUKE: I'm gonna kill him.",
        "LORELAI: Luke, it was no big deal. Please! We all laughed about it. Look, from now on, I'm showering at Babette's, so show's over. No one sees the goods but you. OK?",
        "(Lorelai kisses Luke and exits. She walk past Norman who then approaches Luke, pats him on the back and gives him an approving nod. Luke does not look pleased)",
        "(OPENING CREDITS)",
        "(CUT to Gilmore mansion dining room, morning. Rory and Emily are sitting at the table, having breakfast. A maid serves them)",
        "RORY: They're good.",
        "EMILY: They're stale. And the blueberries aren't even blue. They're red. My God! These blueberries are red!",
        "RORY: They're raspberries.",
        "EMILY: Well the box said they were blueberry. It was printed right on the side.",
        "RORY: Actually, I was in the kitchen, and the box said...",
        "EMILY: (cuts Rory off) She just kills me, that woman.",
        "RORY: It really wasn't as provocative as you think, Grandma.",
        "EMILY: (picks up a piece of paper and starts reading from it) \"On my last visit to the office, I noticed the foliage on the right side of the entrance looked a little peaked. We might want to let the gardener know. Ta, ladies.\"",
        "RORY: Again. It's not exactly Martin Luther nailing the 95 theses to a door.",
        "EMILY: It's implying that I have no control over my hirelings at the DAR. I'm the president. The foliage on the right side of the door, which looks fine, by the way, is my responsibility. This is a direct frontal assault on my leadership. The woman's plotting a coup.",
        "RORY: This is Constance, right?",
        "EMILY: Constance Betterton. Ever since the Mastersons' Christmas party, when I mentioned that Constance's husband sells used cars for a living, which he does - he calls them \"pre-owned\", but they are used - she's had it in for me. She's gonna run against me in the next election. You don't try to oust a president of the DAR, after one term. It's an insult!",
        "RORY: I think you will beat her handily.",
        "EMILY: Did I tell you she tried to push me down the stairs once?",
        "RORY: Look, Grandma. Don't worry. You have someone on the inside now.",
        "RORY: I do? Who?",
        "RORY: Me.",
        "EMILY: Oh. Yes!",
        "RORY: I'll keep an eye on Constance, from now on. Let you know when she comes in, when she uses the computer, when she's inspecting the landscaping...",
        "EMILY: Well, that's wonderful! But stay out of the stairwell.",
        "RORY: Will do.",
        "EMILY: (starts eating her breakfast) Mmm! Raspberry. I like raspberry!",
        "(CUT to Community Service, morning. Rory is walking around doing her Community service with great ease and determination. She seems to have taken up a leading role in the whole garbage picking thing)",
        "COMMUNITY WORKER1: Twist ties?",
        "RORY: Twist ties over there. Is that bag half full or half empty, Jules? Oh, you're making me an optimist, my friend.",
        "LIZA: (walks up to Rory) Rory?",
        "RORY: Liza?",
        "LIZA: (needy) Rory?",
        "RORY: No! We agreed. Not until the end of your shift.",
        "LIZA: But, I don't think the patch works on me. (she lifts her shirt a bit to reveal her stomach, and we see she's wearing several nicotine patches)",
        "RORY: That is like a billion milligrams of nicotine.",
        "LIZA: Is that bad?",
        "RORY: Just, go sit by the cooler, have some water, and take those off. (Liza walks away)",
        "ROAD SUPERVISOR: (approaches Rory) Problem?",
        "RORY: No. I just told her to get water. She seems really dehydrated.",
        "ROAD SUPERVISOR: Looks pretty good.",
        "RORY: Yeah! I think we've hit a really good rhythm here. I've paired up Rinaldi and Spiro, which worked out very efficiently. Sanderson got a little grumpy toward the end of the day, but it's 'cause he wants to be noticed, and he is by far our best spearman. Also we need to remember to pack a couple of extra trash spears tomorrow. The McFarland brothers are using the trash pickup to get out some of that pent-up aggression, which is psychologically healthy but hard on the equipment.",
        "ROAD SUPERVISOR: Got it. So, what's it looking like?",
        "RORY: Well, our quota's up. The kids are tired. I think it's time to call it a day.",
        "ROAD SUPERVISOR: Do it!",
        "RORY: All right, everybody. Let's bring it in! (the community workers start gathering their stuff)",
        "LIZA: Hey! A bunch of the girls are going out for pizza, if you want to come.",
        "COMMUNITY WORKER2: I'll come.",
        "LIZA: Are you a girl?",
        "COMMUNITY WORKER2: No.",
        "RORY: I would, but I can't. I've got a 3-hour shift at the nursing home.",
        "LIZA: I can't believe how much community service they stuck you with. What the hell'd you do?",
        "RORY: I shot a man in Reno. (Liza starts laughing and after bit it turns into coughing) Give it! (Liza gives Rory a pack of cigarettes, and the girls start to walk off, while Liza is still coughing)",
        "(CUT to Dragonfly Inn, morning. Lorelai and Paris are having some sort of lunch date at the Inn dining room. They are sitting at a table, Paris is talking and Lorelai looks bored)",
        "PARIS: The truth is, this is the first time in my life that I've consistently spent the night with a man.",
        "LORELAI: Uh huh...",
        "PARIS: I don't know the rules. Obviously, the clothes have to come off for the actual s*x part of the evening, but, afterward, what are you supposed to do? I mean nightgowns are obviously out, but wearing nothing seems extreme. And, in case of fire, completely impractical.",
        "LORELAI: I'm sure.",
        "PARIS: I wore a camisole one night. It almost strangled me. And I'm definitely not a teddy girl, so what does that leave?",
        "LORELAI: Um...t-shirts.",
        "PARIS: But what does a t-shirt say about me?",
        "LORELAI: Well...",
        "PARIS: More importantly: what does it say to Doyle about me?",
        "LORELAI: Sweetie, it's just a t-shirt. They don't tend to be that chatty.",
        "PARIS: I don't know. Maybe I should reconsider the \"completely naked\" option. After all, I'm 21. If not now, when? I mean, right now, my ass is probably as good as it's ever going to get. I should exploit that, right?",
        "LORELAI: Absolutely! Buy a video camera and go to town.",
        "PARIS: You know what? I'm starting to fade here.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, me too. Listen, it's been a terrific lunch...",
        "PARIS: I think I'll get another espresso.",
        "LORELAI: Actually, we're out of espresso.",
        "PARIS: You are?",
        "LORELAI: Yes! Uh...We shut the machine down at three o'clock to give it a rest. 'Cause it's Italian, so it's a little temperamental.",
        "PARIS: Oh. Okay. Well, then, I guess I should...",
        "LORELAI: (cuts Paris off)...Go? Really? Okay. Well, hmm. (she gets up and Paris follows her lead, then Lorelai starts kinda pushing Paris towards the Inn's main entrance) Sweetie, it's been a blast, again.",
        "PARIS: OK. So, I guess I'll see you Tuesday.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, Tuesday. Perfect. Can't wait. Mmmmmkay. (Paris exits the Inn and Lorelai walks away)",
        "(CUT to Dragonfly Inn kitchen, continuous. Michel is standing there doing...well nothing, as Sookie is working and Lorelai walks in)",
        "MICHEL: Is she gone?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, she's gone.",
        "MICHEL: Thank God!",
        "LORELAI: I can't believe you're in here hiding from a little girl. (walks over to the coffee pot and starts pouring some in a cup)",
        "MICHEL: Oh, yes, you can.",
        "LORELAI: She has a tough exterior, but on the inside Paris is...",
        "MICHEL: Tokyo Rose!",
        "LORELAI: She's lonely. She does not have a lot of friends.",
        "SOOKIE: No! Shocker!",
        "LORELAI: Sookieeee...",
        "SOOKIE: No! No \"Sookie\". She's horrible. I mean, she sends everything back twice, and she makes the waiters write down exactly what she wants me to know is wrong with the food.",
        "MICHEL: At least you're hidden in here. I'm out there, behind a desk, exposed to all of her elements.",
        "LORELAI: Michel!",
        "MICHEL: She mocked my accent. She called me \"Canadian\".",
        "SOOKIE: It's enough already. I won't cook for her anymore.",
        "MICHEL: (distasteful) Lunches.",
        "SOOKIE: Twice a week for three weeks?",
        "MICHEL: They are creepy. The next thing you know, you'll be carrying Emmanuel Lewis around on your shoulders.",
        "SOOKIE: We don't have time for this, Lorelai. We have a wedding this week. I've got a menu to plan and a cake to design. I don't have time to map out the fish patterns for my wild salmon.",
        "LORELAI: OK, OK! I'm sorry if she's bothering you guys. I... What can I do? I gave her my cell phone number. I told her to call, I just didn't think she'd use it sooo often.",
        "SOOKIE: Well, cut it off.",
        "LORELAI: I feel sorry for her.",
        "MICHEL: No one likes to be pitied.",
        "LORELAI: Fine. I have to cut it off. I know. I will.",
        "MICHEL: Do you promise?",
        "LORELAI: I promise.",
        "SOOKIE: Good! Because I've got a lot of work to do. And we've got a ton of planning to do for this wedding next week, and the menu's a mess, and the cake... (gasps) I was thinking about doing a red velvet cake, but I don't know. And I'm using this wedding as a trial run, so it has to be perfect.",
        "LORELAI: A trial run for what?",
        "SOOKIE: For your wedding.",
        "LORELAI: oh.",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah...Which will be when?",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "SOOKIE: When?",
        "LORELAI: When what?",
        "SOOKIE: When will you be getting married? I'm gonna need a date.",
        "LORELAI: we...We haven't set one yet.",
        "SOOKIE: well...I had Michel black out all of July for next year.",
        "LORELAI: You what!",
        "SOOKIE: I figured you and Luke for an outdoorsy summer wedding.",
        "LORELAI: Who and Luke?",
        "SOOKIE: July 23rd is my pick, but I am flexible.",
        "LORLAI: Michel, unblack it out.",
        "MICHEL: I told you.",
        "LORELAI: \"I told you\" what?",
        "MICHEL: I told her that you were not getting married.",
        "LORELAI: I am getting married.",
        "SOOKEI: (disappointed and a bit shocked) You were right. You called it.",
        "MICHEL: The woman can't commit to a purse, much less a man.",
        "LORELAI: I am getting married.",
        "SOOKIE: I am so naive. I believed.",
        "MICHEL: Live and learn.",
        "LORELAI: Hey! I am getting married. I am. We will set a date. And we will get married on that date. And I've had the same purse for almost a year, thank you very much.",
        "MICHEL: Of course. My mistake. Now let me go cancel your wedding plans. (exits)",
        "LORELAI: (calls after Michel) Those are not my wedding plans. They are Sookie's wedding plans.",
        "SOOKIE: Well! Fine, then! What are your wedding plans?",
        "LORELAI: They haven't been formalized, yet.",
        "SOOKIE: What does that mean?",
        "LORELAI: Sookie, come on! I got men running around my house, a completely destroyed bedroom. Things are crazy right now. When they calm down, and Luke and I get a chance to breathe, we will talk and set the date. Until then, can we drop it, please?",
        "SOOKIE: Fine. It's dropped.",
        "MICHEL: (runs in the kitchen) She's back! She's coming back!",
        "SOOKIE: No!",
        "LORELAI: Why?!",
        "MICHEL: I don't know why. Maybe she left her phone or her spell book. All I knw is she's heading back toward the Inn, and I'm not going out until she leaves.",
        "LORELAI: Michel, you're being ridiculous. You're a grown man and you have a job to do.",
        "MICHEL: So do you. And I don't see you rushing out.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I can't, 'cause I'm not done with my coffee yet. (holds up her cup) Mmm! Good to the last drop.",
        "(CUT to DAR office, morning. Rory is sitting at her desk typing something oh her PC. The phone rings. Rory picks it up)",
        "RORY: Daughters Of The American Revolution. Mrs. Tarkington, yes. I've got your application right here. Sandra Tarkington. Um...I guess we just need to make 100% sure that you're related to a verifiable patriot, because we couldn't substantiate it on our end. Well, see, that's the thing. The fact that you found a musket in your great-uncle's attic doesn't necessarily mean you're related to a revolutionary war patriot. Yeah. (Emily comes in the office) Unfortunately. Even if your great-uncle Nate swore on your aunt Kissy's grave that it was so. It's documented genealogy, preferably notarised. Could you hold on for a moment? (Puts the call on hold. To Emily) Psst. Where's Julia?",
        "EMILY: Slinked to the back after I tore down Constance's letter.",
        "RORY: Good, 'cause I've got some gossip.",
        "EMILY: (sits on a chair. Excited and in a co spiriting manor) My own little Valerie Plame. What's the news?",
        "RORY: OK. So, I was at lunch with some of the girls, and I started sniffing around. Just casually asking if anyone had any funny stories about Constance.",
        "EMILY: You sly fox!",
        "RORY: So, one of the girls tells me that about three months ago, she was in the office with Constance, and as Constance was heading out for lunch, she stumbled and dropped her purse, and her altoids box popped open, spilling out enough funny-looking pills to fill a pharmacy. Constance claimed that they were all vitamins. Julia didn't buy it. Because he minute the pills spilled out, Constance threw herself on top of them to cover them up.",
        "EMILY: A cover-up! That's good! That's what took Nixon down. Oh, this is so exciting! I love having a mole. We should go buy you a trench coat and fedora.",
        "RORY: I suggested to the girls that next week we invite Constance to lunch. Get a couple drinks in her and see what comes up.",
        "EMILY: Who knew that behind such a sweet face lurked the soul of a spy?",
        "RORY: I prefer the term \"woman of mystery and intrigue\". (cell phone rings) Excuse me. (answers the phone) Hello?",
        "PARIS: (on the phone) Rory?",
        "RORY: Oh, hey, Paris. (Emily gets up)",
        "PARIS: (on the phone) Hey. We need to talk. Is this a bad time? (Emily excuses herself)",
        "RORY: (whispering to Emily) Okay. (to Paris on the phone) No, no, now's a fine time. What's up?",
        "PARIS: (at the Yale coffee stand. Scene cuts between Paris at Yale, and Rory at the office) Good. This hard-to-reach thing was getting old.",
        "RORY: I'm all yours, Paris.",
        "PARIS: I have to put down a security deposit",
        "today, by five o'clock, or we lose the place.",
        "RORY: What place?",
        "PARIS: Our place.",
        "RORY: Our place where?",
        "PARIS: Our off-campus place. You're hard to reach in a myriad of ways.",
        "RORY: Paris, we don't have a place. I'm not moving off campus with you.",
        "PARIS: Why?",
        "RORY: Because I no longer go to campus.",
        "PARIS: So you're sticking with this \"not going to Yale\" thing of yours?",
        "RORY: Yes, I am.",
        "PARIS: Is this about the boat?",
        "RORY: How do you know about the boat?",
        "PARIS: Oh, come on. It's out there.",
        "RORY: Out there? Why is it out there? How is it out there?",
        "PARIS: I read about it on Rebecca Thurston's blog.",
        "RORY: You're kidding.",

        "LANE: Well, as you know, each gig paid us a little something, and we stayed free at people's houses along the way, and we sold a decent amount of t-shirts, so, besides food, which we consumed in moderation, there were days that we spent practically nothing.",
        "ZACH: Yeah?",
        "LANE: Well...I wanted us to come out of this tour with something. So I figured the best way to motivate us, to save, would be to fib a little on how much we had.",

        "LANE: Actually, a lot. But it paid off big, guys, because we're going home with over $9,000. (they guys look up at Lane in disbelief and a bit pissed) Huh? $9,000, American dollars. Why aren't you guys jumping up and down?",

        "LORELAI: I will get my own stuff, thank you. (starts walking to the house, but backtracks) Wooo, now I just have to figure out what to do with Paul Anka. You know, I've never left him alone so late before, and he might start doing that howling thing the neighbours are so fond of. But...well, that's okay. So...Oh! You know, I guess I could just leave him here and I can come back and get him after work, which will be, oh! two, three, four in the morning. Boy. Late. (looks for a reaction from Luke. He seems to not be getting the hint) Or I could drop him off at a kennel for a few hours. I know there's a good one in Woodbridge, 20 miles away. Of course, I'd have to leave now and pick up some dilithium crystals on the way to fix the warp drive in my jeep so that I could drive there and back in time to meet the wedding party back at the Inn, but that's doable. (looking at Luke for yet another reaction. He still looks unmoved) Yeah...and then, of course, by the time I get off work and drive all the way back ther",

They do, however, get to answer the phone, and they do get to sign for things and order things, and Tom, there is no such thing as a mystic hammer. And after this very enlightening conversation, you know what I'm starting to think?",

I'm through running your errands. Hold on. That's no mayo. (trades some bags he's already handed out) Here, Ed. I'm done! I quit! You can all kiss any part of me that reaches your general vicinity first. You have seen the last of me. So arrivederci, Roma!

Because this is not my dog. This is my fiance's dog. She loves him. She named him \"Paul Anka\", which may, on the surface, not seem like a sign of love, but if you knew her, you'd get it, and believe me there's a lot of ways I could screw up, but I cannot lose her over the fact I killed her dog.",

There is another soup kitchen down on Hadley, and they serve more vegetables than you do, so I would rather work there anyhow\", and I turned in my apron, and I walked out.",

I've got the candy-striper thing starting next week. I didn't really want that, but I had to take it, because I was supposed to get on the zoo beat, which would have been gross but great cause they'll let you do a double shift.

(Lorelai looks concerned) After that I sat with him for another three hours, holding a bowl of water under his nose to make sure that he was re-hydrating properly, and then I chocolate-proofed the apartment and the diner to make sure that never happens again. (Lorelai looks at Luke lovingly) And now I'm gonna go downstairs and make Paul Anka some scrambled eggs because the vet said that the kibble is gonna be a little hard on his stomach for a couple of days.
