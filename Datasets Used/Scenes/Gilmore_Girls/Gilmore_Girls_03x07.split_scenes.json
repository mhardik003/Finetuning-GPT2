    "Recap": [
        "Lorelai is determined to win the Stars Hollow Dance Marathon and wrest the trophy from four-time champion Kirk, but has trouble getting a partner until she finally convinces Rory to help her dance her way to victory. Dean sits on the sidelines to cheer his girl on, and is soon joined by Jess and Shane, who spend their time making out while Jess keeps his eye on Rory. Lorelai breaks her heel, and Dean takes her place while Luke plays shoe repairman. On the dance floor, Dean realizes that Rory is attracted to Jess and breaks up with her. Rory tearfully runs off, followed closely by Jess, and Kirk is declared the winner once again."

        "[Signs and banners are displayed in the town square promoting the upcoming 24-hour dance marathon. Lorelai is in Luke's Diner, staring out the window at the people walking by]",
        "LUKE: What about that one?",
        "LORELAI: Hm, no.",
        "LUKE: Why not?",
        "LORELAI: Too pale.",
        "LUKE: So what?",
        "LORELAI: Pale means sickly.",
        "LUKE: Or sunscreen.",
        "LORELAI: Or Mad Cow Disease.",
        "LUKE: Pale does not mean Mad Cow Disease.",
        "LORELAI: Have you ever had Mad Cow Disease?",
        "LUKE: Twice last week and my coloring was wonderful.",
        "LORELAI: I need a great dance partner this year. Someone strong, non-clutzy, with lots of stamina. Ooh, how tall is that guy?",
        "LUKE: Mrs. Coulter's about 6'2\".",
        "LORELAI: Oh. Four years in a row, I have come this close to winning. Last year, I swear to God, I had it!",
        "LUKE: I know the story.",
        "LORELAI: It was hour twenty-three.",
        "LUKE: I know the story.",
        "LORELAI: I'm dancing with Henry Ho-Ho McAphie the third.",
        "LUKE: How many people heard me say I know the story?",
        "[several customers raise their hands]",
        "LORELAI: And Ho-Ho's fading, so I'm trying to buck him up, saying \"Come on, Ho-Ho. Stay with me Ho-Ho,\" and then all of a sudden he starts yelling, \"Stop calling me Ho-Ho, it's making me hungry!\"",
        "LUKE: Oh, hey, look, there goes Tommy Tune.",
        "LORELAI: And out of nowhere, Kirk comes dancing by, waving a McDonald's hot apple pie in the air and of course Ho-Ho lunges for the pie and drops my hand and that was it. Kirk wins, I'm out. I'm gonna get that Ho-Ho someday.",
        "LUKE: I'll help ya.",
        "LORELAI: I wanna win.",
        "LUKE: I know you do.",

        "LUKE: Just a code I live by.",
        "TAYLOR: Oh. . .pffft. . .you. Listen, I'd like to run a little something by you.",
        "LUKE: I'm busy, Taylor.",
        "TAYLOR: I was just thinking how nice it would be if you could set up a little coffee stand at the marathon.",
        "LUKE: Coffee stand.",
        "TAYLOR: Yes. I mean, these people have to try and stay up for twenty-four hours. What better to help you stay up than a cup of nice strong cup of coffee, huh? What do you say?",
        "LUKE: Sure.",
        "TAYLOR: Really?",
        "LUKE: For a buck a cup.",
        "TAYLOR: Luke, this marathon is a charitable event.",
        "LUKE: Taylor, we have been raising money to restore that stupid bridge for eight years.",
        "TAYLOR: We're not raising money to restore the bridge.",
        "LUKE: We're not?",
        "TAYLOR: No, we have that money. The Tennessee Williams lookalike contest last month put us right over the top.",
        "LUKE: Then what the hell is this dumb thing for?",
        "TAYLOR: A tarp.",
        "LUKE: A what?",
        "TAYLOR: To cover the bridge.",
        "LUKE: This is a first, Taylor. I actually need to sit down.",
        "TAYLOR: Well, Luke, you know as well as I do that if we start renovations now, heading right into the snow and rainy part of the season, then everything we do is gonna get ruined, and there we are \u0096 back at square one. If we are gonna do this right, then we are going to need a tarp.",
        "LUKE: Taylor, you are asking me to donate free coffee to hundreds of people so you can raise money to buy a tarp.",
        "TAYLOR: How \u0091bout fifty cents a cup?",
        "LUKE: How \u0091bout I charge for cream?",
        "TAYLOR: You would kick Tiny Tim's crutch out from under him, wouldn't you?",
        "LUKE: If he asks for a free cup of coffee, gimpy's going down.",

        "EMILY: Thank you, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: It's like super chicken. I bet it could fly. Have you tried tossing it out the window?",
        "EMILY: All right, what's going on?",
        "LORELAI: What? I like the chicken.",
        "EMILY: Nobody likes the chicken that much, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: I'm in a good mood.",
        "EMILY: Why?",
        "LORELAI: My God, it's my ninth grade homecoming dance all over again.",
        "RORY: Homecoming dance?",
        "LORELAI: In ninth grade, I got asked to the homecoming dance and I didn't think I would, and I was in a really good mood, and Mom got so annoyed that she made me go to my room.",
        "RORY: Grandma?",
        "EMILY: She was sitting at the table giving all the peas voices.",
        "LORELAI: With a little encouragement, I could've been the Senor Wences of the vegetable set.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, okay, okay. It'll come out soon enough. Today, ladies and gentlemen, I found a dance partner.",
        "RORY: You did?",
        "LORELAI: A good one.",
        "EMILY: What are you talking about, a dance partner? A dance partner for what?",
        "LORELAI: Our town is having a dance marathon this weekend.",
        "RORY: It lasts twenty-four hours and the last couple left standing gets a trophy.",
        "LORELAI: A big trophy.",
        "EMILY: Well, that sounds very nice.",
        "RORY: All the proceeds go to charity.",
        "LORELAI: Which is great \u0096 but did I mention the trophy?",
        "RORY: I believe you did.",
        "LORELAI: \u0091Cause it's big.",
        "EMILY: Charitable events are wonderful things to take part in. There's nothing more rewarding than devoting yourself to making someone else's life better.",
        "LORELAI: And whose life isn't better with a truly gigantic trophy around?",
        "RORY: So who'd you get to dance with you?",
        "LORELAI: Stanley Appleman.",
        "RORY: Who's Stanley Appleman?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, he's brand new in town. He works over at the hardware store, and the best part is, he used to be part of the touring company. . .of Riverdance.",
        "RORY: Score!",
        "LORELAI: I know! I'm completely jazzed. How \u0091bout you, Mr. Potato? I'm completely jazzed, too.",
        "[a phone rings]",
        "EMILY: What's that?",
        "LORELAI: I think that's me.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai, I've told you a hundred times to turn that thing off when you come to dinner here.",
        "LORELAI: I know, Mom. I'm sorry.",
        "EMILY: Can't you let it go to voice mail?",
        "LORELAI: Well, see, I left Michel alone at the inn, and he's dealing with the roofers. I told him to call me if there was any trouble. [goes to answer the phone]",
        "EMILY: Is that true?",
        "RORY: I'm gonna let Mr. Potato field this one.",
        "EMILY: I thought so.",
        "[Lorelai answers the phone in the next room]",
        "LORELAI: Hello? . . . What? . . . Oh, no no, no no, don't tell me that. . .Well, did you tell her how big the trophy is, because I am really not exaggerating here. . . How did your wife get a picture of me? Stanley, that is crazy! I don't wanna sleep with you. . . Did you tell her I don't wanna sleep with you? . . . Well, put her on the phone. I'll tell her I don't wanna sleep with you. . . Well, somebody has to tell her I don't wanna sleep with you. . . Why are you insulted all of a sudden? . . . Stanley? . . .",

        "LORELAI: Great.",
        "RORY: What happened?",
        "LORELAI: Stanley bailed.",
        "RORY: No! Why?",
        "LORELAI: Apparently, Miss Patty showed his wife a picture of me, and she thinks I look like Elizabeth Taylor, which makes her Debbie Reynolds, and Stanley Eddie Fisher.",
        "RORY: That's crazy.",
        "LORELAI: Especially if you've seen Stanley. He's no Eddie Fisher, trust me. Fisher Stevens, maybe.",
        "RORY: Can't you talk to her?",
        "LORELAI: Apparently, only at my own risk.",
        "EMILY: Well, at least she thought you looked like Elizabeth Taylor. That was nice.",
        "LORELAI: I have no partner.",
        "RORY: You'll find another one.",
        "EMILY: Elizabeth Taylor always did.",
        "RORY: There's someone else out there, trust me.",
        "LORELAI: I guess.",
        "EMILY: Here. Have some more chicken.",
        "LORELAI: Thanks, Mom.",

        "PARIS: I think we need to work. The seventy-fifth anniversary issue of the Franklin comes out next month and I want it to be amazing.",
        "RORY: I've got some great cover art lined up.",
        "PARIS: Old pictures, new pictures?",
        "RORY: Collage style with kind of a sepia-toned finish to it. Very classy.",
        "PARIS: Okay, I like it. Time!",
        "[Louise and Madeline stop kissing the guys and say goodbye to them]",

        "MADELINE: So, what were we talking about?",
        "PARIS: Working Saturday on the seventy-fifth anniversary issue.",
        "LOUISE: Thanks for asking.",
        "MADELINE: But you guys already have some decent stuff planned out, right?",
        "PARIS: Madeline -- or may I call you Spicoli?",
        "MADELINE: If you have to.",
        "PARIS: This is the seventy-fifth anniversary issue. There is only going to be one seventy-fifth anniversary issue ever, and it's on our watch. We screw this up and we basically mooned a piece of history. Is that what you want? To B.A. history?",
        "MADELINE: But I don't understand. Last year was the seventy-fourth anniversary issue of the Franklin.",
        "PARIS: So?",
        "MADELINE: So there's only gonna be one seventy-fourth anniversary issue ever and we didn't do anything special for it.",
        "LOUISE: I think the cover was of a deep-fried Mars bar.",
        "PARIS: That's because nobody cares about the seventy-fourth anniversary issue.",
        "MADELINE: I bet the person who worked on it seventy-four years ago did.",
        "PARIS: We're working Saturday!",
        "[Paris and Rory walk outside]",
        "PARIS: \"Why are we working Saturday, Paris? What's so special about the seventy-fifth issue, Paris? Why does my head feel so light and yet not float away, Paris?\"",
        "[Paris sees Jamie across the courtyard]",
        "RORY: What?",
        "PARIS: What's he doing here?",
        "RORY: I bet he's here to see you.",
        "PARIS: He hasn't called me once. I haven't seen or heard from him since we had our date in Washington three months ago.",
        "RORY: Maybe he wants to explain why.",
        "PARIS: He was supposed to go away and never come back. I already wrote his name in my revenge notebook.",
        "RORY: Paris, he knows you're standing here talking about him.",
        "PARIS: What does he want?",
        "RORY: Go over there and find out.",
        "[Paris walks over to Jamie]",
        "PARIS: What do you want?",
        "JAMIE: I'm on break from school, I thought I'd come down and see you.",
        "PARIS: But you never called.",
        "JAMIE: I know.",
        "PARIS: You lost my number?",
        "JAMIE: Nope, I memorized your number.",
        "PARIS: You didn't wanna use my number?",
        "JAMIE: I was starting classes.",
        "PARIS: In phone dialing? How's it going?",
        "JAMIE: Look, Paris, this year's very important for me. I thought the last thing I needed was a distraction.",
        "PARIS: Well, I totally understand. This year's very important for me, too. I'm focusing on getting into Harvard, and the last thing that I need is a distraction. . . so, good move. You saved us both a lot of distractions. Thank you, and good luck. [they shake hands, but Jamie doesn't let go] I need my hand.",
        "JAMIE: If I let go, how fast will you run away?",
        "PARIS: 3.2 seconds.",
        "JAMIE: I thought so. Hey Rory.",
        "RORY: Hey Jamie. How's Princeton?",
        "JAMIE: It's good. Crazy, but \u0096",
        "PARIS: Let go.",
        "JAMIE: No.",
        "PARIS: Yes.",
        "JAMIE: Paris.",
        "PARIS: Look, you don't have to be nice, you don't have to tie up loose ends. I get it, I'm a distraction. Now either pull a Boxing Helena, or give me back my hand.",
        "JAMIE: Yes, talking to you would've been a distraction.",
        "PARIS: I know. I heard you already. My God, find a pirate to sit on, okay?",
        "JAMIE: However, not talking to you has turned out to be impossible.",
        "PARIS: What?",
        "JAMIE: I flunked a pop quiz in poli-sci because I couldn't stop thinking about you. Still want your hand back?",
        "PARIS: I've got another.",
        "JAMIE: I've thought a lot about this, and apparently you're a distraction that I'm supposed to have.",
        "PARIS: You didn't have a bad time on the date?",
        "JAMIE: Are you busy right now?",
        "PARIS: Well \u0096",
        "RORY: No, we're done. She's free.",
        "JAMIE: Good. Let's go get some coffee. Bye Rory.",
        "RORY: Bye Jamie.",
        "[Jamie takes Paris' books from her and walks away]",
        "PARIS: He took my books.",

        "[Rory, Dean, and Lane are in the living room. Lane is on the phone]",
        "RORY: Well?",
        "LANE: Still ringing. [a moment later, she hangs up] He's home.",
        "RORY: How'd he sound?",
        "LANE: Homey.",
        "RORY: Nice.",
        "DEAN: I know this is a stupid question, but why can't you just talk to him?",
        "LANE: Because yesterday he called to say that they were still looking for a rehearsal space and, uh, that he'd call when he had more news. So now I have to wait until he calls about the band \u0096 and in between, I call and hang up on him. Pathetic.",
        "RORY: Not so pathetic. I used to hang up on Dean all the time.",
        "DEAN: You did?",
        "LANE: I remember that.",
        "DEAN: When did you hang up on me?",
        "RORY: Right when we first met.",
        "DEAN: You should've just said something.",
        "RORY: I couldn't do that.",
        "DEAN: Why not?",
        "RORY: Because then you would've known that I was calling and therefore that I liked you.",
        "DEAN: Yes, but I liked you, too.",
        "RORY: Well, I know that now.",
        "DEAN: You could've known that then.",
        "RORY: Dean, please. This is a girl thing.",
        "DEAN: Uh, okay. Tell me when I'm supposed to pay attention again.",
        "LANE: I'm gonna love him forever and he's never gonna know it.",
        "DEAN: He would if you coughed.",
        "RORY: Dean.",
        "DEAN: Sorry.",
        "LANE: At least he's at home and not out with a girl.",
        "RORY: Very true.",
        "DEAN: He could be home with a girl.",
        "RORY: Dean.",

        "[Lorelai walks through the front door]",
        "LORELAI: Ooh, cool, pizza.",
        "RORY: Shh. She's calling Dave to see if she can hear a girl in the background.",
        "LORELAI: Oh.",
        "DEAN: I voted that she actually say something.",
        "LORELAI: You're a boy, you know nothing about this.",
        "RORY: Well, what'd you hear?",
        "LANE: Quadrophenia.",
        "RORY: Classy, but not date-like.",
        "LANE: You think?",
        "RORY: Definitely.",
        "DEAN: What if he met a girl who's a major Who fan?",
        "LANE: What?",
        "RORY: Why are you causing trouble?",
        "LORELAI: Rory, can I talk to you in the kitchen?",
        "RORY: Oh, sure. [to Dean] Be good.",
        "[Rory and Lorelai leave the room; Lane sits next to Dean on the couch]",
        "DEAN: Go ahead.",

        "[cut to Lorelai and Rory in the kitchen]",
        "RORY: Okay, so, what's on your mind?",

        "[Lorelai stares at Rory]",
        "RORY: Bye.",
        "LORELAI: Come on!",
        "RORY: Forget it.",
        "LORELAI: Just hear me out. First of all, you love me.",
        "RORY: Not right at this moment, I don't.",
        "LORELAI: You know how much this contest means to me. You'd never fall asleep or chase a pie.",
        "RORY: I do not dance.",
        "LORELAI: It'll be fun. We'll get all dressed up, and you're light \u0096 easy to hold up when you get tired.",
        "RORY: Mom.",
        "LORELAI: Plus, we got the whole mother/daughter gimmick going for us. The crowd'll eat that up.",
        "RORY: I cannot dance with you.",
        "LORELAI: Why not?",
        "RORY: Because this is Dean's first marathon. We were gonna go and watch and hang out, he's totally looking forward to it. I told him about how Andrew gets in a fight with his date in the first fifteen minutes and storms off the floor. I told him about Taylor getting punch-drunk at hour fifteen and telling stories about how he always wanted to be a magician.",
        "LORELAI: Rory, please.",
        "RORY: And ooh, I told him about how when Kirk wins, he likes to take his victory lap around the floor to the theme from Rocky. I was gonna show him all those things, and I was gonna show them to him sitting down.",
        "LORELAI: He can still come, and he can still see all those things, except if you dance, maybe that victory lap will be you and me instead of Kirk.",
        "RORY: Okay, I'll tell you what. I was supposed to work on the Franklin this weekend with Paris.",
        "LORELAI: But?",
        "RORY: I will ask her if we can reschedule. If she says yes, then I will dance with you.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I love ya!",
        "RORY: You should sell cars.",
        "LORELAI: I should, shouldn't I? Hello, big fancy trophy.",

        "PARIS: I was close.",
        "RORY: It's on Saturday, and it's a twenty-four hour thing and my mother really wants to win, and her partner bailed on her and, long story short, I was wondering if there was anyway we could move this Saturday's Franklin thing to next Saturday.",
        "PARIS: Okay.",
        "MADELINE: What did she say?",
