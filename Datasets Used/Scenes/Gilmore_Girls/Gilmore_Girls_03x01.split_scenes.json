        "OPEN IN LORELAI'S BEDROOM",
        "[Lorelai is asleep in bed when her alarm goes off. She shuts it off, and a second later, several others start going off around her bedroom.]",
        "LORELAI: You are hilarious!",
        "[She gets up and walks down to the kitchen, where Luke is at the stove making breakfast]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, see, last night, when I said to you, \u0091Tomorrow, no matter what, make sure I get up at seven,' what I actually meant was, \u0091Tomorrow, no matter what, make sure I have the option of getting up at seven in case when seven comes, I actually wanna get up,' which \u0096 as it happened \u0096 I didn't. Therefore, you're currently responsible for the great alarm clock slaughter of 2002.",
        "[She pulls a container of coffee out of the freezer]",
        "LUKE: No survivors?",
        "LORELAI: The one shaped like a bunny escaped with a mild decapitation. [smells the coffee] This is decaf.",
        "LUKE: What are you talking about?",
        "LORELAI: You switched my coffee again.",
        "[Lorelai searches the kitchen for the regular coffee]",
        "LUKE: I'm a busy man. I don't have time to sneak around switching your coffee. I have a diner to run, I have shipments to order, I have things to flip and fry. Will you stop that?",
        "[Lorelai finds the bag of regular coffee under the sink]",
        "LORELAI: Ha, haha, hahaha! Under the sink, very clever, but not clever enough bucko.",
        "LUKE: Okay, fine, you know what? I give up.",
        "LORELAI: Woo hoo!",
        "LUKE: Go one day without coffee.",
        "LORELAI: That's not giving up.",
        "LUKE: I'll put a toy in your cereal.",
        "LORELAI: Dirty!",
        "LUKE: [hands her a plate of food] Fine, here, you win.",
        "LORELAI: Thank you.",
        "LUKE: You're welcome. Now you're up, you're fed, I'm leaving.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, hey, we need q-tips.",
        "LUKE: I'll alert the media.",
        "LORELAI: See, that's better with the accent.",
        "LUKE: The reference is enough, you'll learn that one day. I'll be home early, anything besides the q-tips?",
        "LORELAI: Um, cotton balls, world peace, Connie Chung's original face back.",
        "[Luke kisses her]",
        "LUKE: Goodbye crazy lady. [to Lorelai's stomach] Goodbye Sid and Nancy.",
        "LORELAI: Leopold and Loeb.",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: I changed my mind, don't tell Rory.",
        "LUKE: Decaf.",
        "LORELAI: Never.",
        "LUKE: They'll both have two heads.",
        "LORELAI: More to love.",
        "[They kiss again and Luke walks out the back door]",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S BEDROOM",
        "[In the middle of the night, Lorelai wakes up suddenly from her dream. She falls out of the bed reaching for the phone]",
        "LORELAI: Whoa! Ugh!",
        "[She calls Rory at her dorm in Washington]",
        "RORY: Hello?",
        "LORELAI: You have to come home.",
        "RORY: Mom?",
        "LORELAI: You're gone and the house is quiet and Bill Maher's canceled. The name of the show was Politically Incorrect for God's sake. Didn't anybody read the title? He was supposed to say those things, dammit!",
        "RORY: You had another dream.",
        "LORELAI: Yes.",
        "RORY: The doctor is in.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, I'm lying in bed and I'm sleeping and I'm wearing this fabulous nightgown, and like thirty alarm clocks go off, and so I get out of bed and I walk downstairs, and there, standing is the kitchen, is Luke!",
        "RORY: Was he naked?",
        "LORELAI: No! He was making breakfast.",
        "RORY: Naked?",
        "LORELAI: Okay, you've been in Washington way too long.",
        "RORY: Sorry. Go ahead, he was making breakfast. . .",
        "LORELAI: Eggs and pancakes and bacon, and he put decaf coffee in my regular coffee bag, which of course I knew immediately.",
        "RORY: Hi, the nose.",
        "LORELAI: Exactly. So eventually I find the real stuff under the sink. He hands me my breakfast, and then . . .",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: He kissed me and talked to my stomach!",
        "RORY: Why would he do that?",
        "LORELAI: Because apparently I'm pregnant!",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: With twins! [pause] Say something.",
        "RORY: You are going to be so fat.",
        "LORELAI: Just analyze my dream, please.",
        "RORY: Okay. Well, your dream was telling you that you are secretly in love with Luke and you wanna marry him and have his twins.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, no, try again.",
        "RORY: What do you mean, try again? You asked me to analyze your dream, I analyzed your dream.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, well, I reject that analysis, so I'd like another one, please.",
        "RORY: You can't just reject an analysis and try again. You're not shopping for bathing suits here.",
        "LORELAI: Give me another analysis or I'll put your Taylor hula-hooping dream into a whole other context.",
        "RORY: I told you, Taylor was supposed to be Dean. I could tell by his freakishly thick head of hair.",
        "LORELAI: I'm waiting.",
        "RORY: Okay, maybe you're still upset about what happened with Dad and you're jealous of Sherry because she's having his baby and not you. Mom?",
        "LORELAI: I miss you.",
        "RORY: I miss you, too.",
        "PARIS: [sleeptalking in background] Woodward. . .Bernstein. . .Harry Thomason.",
        "LORELAI: Is that Paris?",
        "RORY: Yeah, she talks in her sleep. . . long in-depth arguments. I'm so glad I only have one more day here.",
        "LORELAI: Me, too. What do you have on your agenda for tomorrow? Or, today, actually.",
        "RORY: We have a breakfast mixer with members of Congress and the Senate.",
        "LORELAI: Cool. See if you can steal me something off of Tom Daschle's fruit plate.",
        "RORY: I'll see what I can do.",
        "LORELAI: See you Friday, doc.",
        "RORY: See you Friday.",
        "[Rory walks to her desk and sits down, where she tries to work on a letter to Jess]",
        "PARIS: [sleeptalking] I did not have sexual relations with that woman.",

        "CUT TO SOOKIE AND JACKSON'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai and Sookie are sitting at the kitchen table]",
        "LORELAI: No way.",
        "SOOKIE: I swear.",
        "LORELAI: Huh, Kosher bacon.",
        "SOOKIE: Beef not pork.",
        "LORELAI: I am so Jewish.",
        "JACKSON: [from other room] Hey Sookie, where's my \u0096",
        "SOOKIE: Jackson, hold on! Lorelai's here!",
        "LORELAI: [covers eyes] Oh, Jackson, I'm in the kitchen! I'm eating bacon, so don't . . aye - eh - da - ahhh!",
        "JACKSON: [walks into kitchen] Will you stop it? I'm dressed.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, well, how do I know you weren't showering and the hot water went out and you rushed down here with nothing but a teeny tiny towel in front of ya.",
        "JACKSON: Once, that happened once.",
        "LORELAI: Well, once was enough.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, hey, honey, I got those paint chips that we were talking about. Do you wanna look at them now?",
        "JACKSON: Nope.",
        "SOOKIE: But it'll only take a minute and I actually went though and picked out a couple of colors for you.",
        "LORELAI: What are you painting?",
        "JACKSON: Nothing.",
        "SOOKIE: The house.",
        "LORELAI: The whole house?",
        "JACKSON: No.",
        "SOOKIE: Just the inside.",
        "LORELAI: Ah, that's a pretty big undertaking.",
        "JACKSON: It's not such a big undertaking since we're not undertaking it.",
        "SOOKIE: I know, but it'll be fun.",
        "LORELAI: Rory and I'll help if you want.",
        "JACKSON: Okay, if you're gonna come over here everyday, you have to actually hear both of us.",
        "LORELAI: Oh. Well, tell me why you're not painting just the inside of the house?",
        "SOOKIE: Because it was my house and now it's our house and I want it to feel like our house.",
        "JACKSON: I'm totally happy with the way this house feels.",
        "SOOKIE: How can you be? There's flowers everywhere.",
        "JACKSON: I like flowers \u0096 I'm a produce guy.",
        "SOOKIE: The curtains are ruffly.",
        "JACKSON: I like ruffles.",
        "SOOKIE: How can you like ruffles?",
        "JACKSON: Because I'm very, very gay.",
        "SOOKIE: Jackson!",
        "JACKSON: Judy, Vincent has to go to work now. Goodbye Lorelai. Tell her I'm fine, I like things just the way they are.",
        "LORELAI: I'll try.",
        "[Jackson leaves]",
        "LORELAI: All right, I've only got a minute and then I have to leave. Is there any more bacon?",
        "SOOKIE: Have mine. What do you think about mahogany for the living room and then midnight blue for the hallway and the bedroom?",
        "LORELAI: Sookie, Jackson just said he's fine with how everything is. I don't think it's bugging him.",
        "SOOKIE: Well, he may not think so now but it'll bug him eventually and then he'll resent this place and me by extension and I would like to avoid that. And I can \u0096 I just need to butch the place up a little. Now, help me pick a color.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, I can't now, but I'll do it later.",
        "SOOKIE: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: Thanks for breakfast, it was amazing, I love you, I love the bacon. Oh, hey, bacon's manly. Why don't you just nail a bunch of packages of Kosher bacon on the walls, huh? Smells like meat blessed by a rabbi \u0096 now that's a manly house.",
        "SOOKIE: Buh-bye.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, but if you're still thinking paint, you're still thinking like a chick.",
        "CUT TO OUTSIDE",
        "[The town square is being set up for a festival. Lorelai walks toward Taylor, who is in an electric wheelchair giving orders to people.]",
        "TAYLOR: Watch those streamers! And not too much red near that tree \u0096 light touch, light touch, light touch.",
        "LORELAI: Hey Taylor, how's the leg?",
        "TAYLOR: It's just fine.",
        "LORELAI: Still haven't found out who put that banana peel on your doorstep, huh?",
        "TAYLOR: No, but I have a list of suspects.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, um, what's all this for?",
        "TAYLOR: This, young lady, is for the first annual Stars Hollow End of Summer Madness Festival.",
        "LORELAI: You finally found a way to fill September, didn't ya?",
        "TAYLOR: This is gonna be a very exciting day. I'm really gonna go all out for this. I even think you'll be impressed.",
        "LORELAI: Really, even me?",
        "TAYLOR: Yes-sir-ee, mini-me, I did not put the word madness in the title for nothing. This place is gonna be crazy, wild \u0096 food, games, we've even got a band coming all the way from New York!",
        "LORELAI: New York \u0096 that's just nuts!",
        "TAYLOR: And wait \u0091til you see the banner I ordered. It's gonna make every other banner we've ever had look downright embarrassing.",
        "LORELAI: Taylor, you're on fire.",
        "TAYLOR: Oh, I love this banner!",
        "LORELAI: I can't wait to see it.",
        "TAYLOR: Well, come on Friday. [to girl walking by] Uh, excuse me, uh, young lady. . .young lady? You know I'm talking to you. The blonde woman with the ribbons, please slow down. I'm in a wheelchair, young lady, I can't run after you.",
        "[As Taylor follows the girl off camera, Lorelai stares into Luke's Diner then sadly walks away]",
        "CUT TO WASHINGTON",
        "[At the Junior Leadership breakfast, Paris is talking with Senator Barbara Boxer]",
        "PARIS: I mean, come on, Senator Boxer, as one of our foremost Democratic leaders, I ask you \u0096 do you really think it looks good to have the American Secretary of the Treasury traveling around with Bono? I mean, I know apparently he's a saint, he's going to save the world, yada, yada, yada, but my God! He never even takes the sunglasses off. We have an image to maintain, don't we? I mean, aren't we at least trying to pretend we're the superpower in this world? I mean, why not just send Carson Daly over to the Middle East next time Cheney goes, huh? Or hey, hook up Freddie Prinze Jr. with Colin Powell next time he meets with NATO. I mean, hell! Let's hear what Freddie has to say, right?",
        "[A man walks by and the Senator grabs his arm]",
        "SENATOR BOXER: Oh, great, Doug. Uh, Paris, do you know Republican Congressman Doug Ose from California? You don't? Great. You two will have so much to talk about. Bye. [walks away]",
        "CONGRESSMAN OSE: Uh, Barbara",
        "PARIS: Ose, right?",
        "CONGRESSMAN OSE: Yes that's right.",
        "PARIS: Let's take a walk.",
        "[cut to Rory at one of the food tables. As she gets herself some coffee, a boy walks up to her]",
        "JAMIE: Last day here.",
        "RORY: Yup.",
        "JAMIE: So, in your opinion, how was our nation's capital?",
        "RORY: Well, I got to see Archie Bunker's chair at the Smithsonian Museum, so it was a big thumbs up for me.",
        "JAMIE: Yes, there are times when this country's priorities are exactly right. So, where's Paris?",
        "RORY: Hm, not quite sure. Last time I saw her, she was beating the will to live out of our nation's representatives.",
        "JAMIE: She is a hammer, isn't she?",
        "RORY: Actually, she's the entire toolbox.",
        "[Paris walks up to them]",
        "PARIS: Damn. I always seem to catch the most interesting politicians right when they have to use the bathroom. Hey Jamie.",
        "[Paris walks over to another table and Jamie follows her]",
        "JAMIE: Paris. Just came over to let you know I got a little sneak peak at the final debate pairings for today. It seems like you and I are going to be on the same side this time.",
        "PARIS: You're kidding? You'd think they'd like to give someone else a fighting chance for once.",
        "JAMIE: Apparently not.",
        "PARIS: God, I love this. You don't realize how unqualified most of America's youth is until you gather them all up in a room and make them speak. So, who are we up against?",
        "JAMIE: Jason Roundsevault and Ty Fredericks.",
        "PARIS: Perfect. Jason's got asthma and Ty cries.",
        "JAMIE: Okay, so we should meet early and go over strategy, make sure you bought enough Kleenex.",
        "PARIS: Good, good.",
        "JAMIE: And then tonight we should get together and celebrate over dinner.",
        "PARIS: What if we don't win?",
        "JAMIE: Don't lose it on me now.",
        "PARIS: You're right.",
        "JAMIE: So, dinner?",
        "PARIS: Sure.",
        "JAMIE: Good, I'll swing around for you about seven.",
        "PARIS: Fine.",
        "JAMIE: Okay, see you at the slaughter.",
        "[Jamie walks away and Rory walks over to Paris]",
        "RORY: Wow!",
        "PARIS: Yeah, can you imagine pairing me with Jamie? I mean, why not just line the hallways with self esteem counselors right now.",
        "RORY: Paris?",
        "PARIS: What?",
        "RORY: What do you mean what? He just asked you out on a date.",
        "PARIS: He did not.",
        "RORY: Yes, he did. You're having dinner with Jamie tonight.",
        "PARIS: It's a victory dinner, that's it.",
        "RORY: Paris, if he just wanted to celebrate winning a debate, you guys could've had coffee afterward, but he asked you out on a date.",
        "PARIS: He did?",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "PARIS: Did I accept?",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "PARIS: I'm going on a date?",
        "RORY: Yes, you are.",
        "PARIS: Oh man, I can't believe this! I finally get asked out on a date and I missed it? Was it a good ask-out?",
        "RORY: It was a very good ask-out.",
        "PARIS: God, I wish I'd been there.",
        "RORY: Well, you'll be there tonight.",
        "PARIS: Tonight? Tonight I have a date. Tonight I have a date with Jamie \u0096 a Princeton man. I can overlook that. Oh my God, I can't believe it. . .I have a date.",

        "KIRK: One day it occurred to me, cows never wrinkle.",
        "MICHEL: Mmhmm.",
        "KIRK: Think about it \u0096 have you ever seen a wrinkled cow? No, not once. So I thought to myself, \"That is weird.\"",
        "MICHEL: Yes, that and other things.",
        "KIRK: So I decided to do a little research. I studied cows, I studied humans, and finally I discovered the secret \u0096 the secret of the cows.",
        "LORELAI: [walking up to them] Michel, could you, uh. . .hi Kirk.",
        "MICHEL: Oh, good, just in time. Kirk here is about to tell us the difference between cows and humans.",
        "LORELAI: You mean, other than one's a cow?",
        "MICHEL: Shh. Go ahead, Kirk.",
        "KIRK: Hay.",
        "LORELAI: Huh?",
        "KIRK: Hay, it's hay \u0096 cows eat hay. And after some experimentation and a great deal of research, I developed what I believe to be the next great skin care product to sweep the nation. [shows them a bottle]",
        "LORELAI: [reads the label] Hay There.",
        "KIRK: A complete line of creams, balms, toning lotions, and cleansing liquids.",
        "LORELAI: Kirk, we already have a skin care line here, I'm sorry.",
        "KIRK: I am willing to give you three cases of \"Hay There\" skin products absolutely free of charge. Try them, you will see what I'm talking about.",
        "LORELAI: Well, uh, thank you very much, Kirk. . . but, I'm sorry \u0096 don't cows eat grass?",
        "KIRK: Sometimes, but \"Grass There\" is a bad name. [leaves]",

        "LORELAI: Mom, it's eleven o'clock in the morning. I said I would call you on Thursday, I didn't say when on Thursday, I just said Thursday. Technically I haven't screwed up for another twelve hours.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai, everyone knows that you are supposed to call people as soon as they have arrived home. That's the polite way to do it.",
        "LORELAI: You didn't tell me what time you were coming home.",
        "EMILY: Well, you never asked what time we were coming home.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, but you never told me so there's no way I could know, so even though I didn't ask I still didn't know and it's only elev. . .I'm sorry.",
        "EMILY: Apology accepted. Now I assume we'll be seeing you and Rory for dinner tomorrow?",

        "RORY: What do you mean, what am I doing? I'm ranting. You should recognize this, I learned it from you.",

        "RORY: I know.",
        "LORELAI: And then you ran off to have some thing with Jess.",
        "RORY: It was a kiss, not a thing.",

        "RORY: It was nothing.",
        "LORELAI: Well, then why are you so freaked out?",
        "RORY: I'm not freaked out.",
        "LORELAI: Look, kid, you have gotta make up your mind. Jess, Dean, Jess, Dean \u0096 it's enough already. If you want Jess, that's fine \u0096 go get him, there he is. If you think that's the great love of your life, then great. . .grab a liver treat and a squeaky toy and run to him. Don't worry about that girl because I'm sure he will have moved onto somebody else in about an hour. But do something. Dean has been sweet and supportive and incredibly patient, and now you are officially treating him like dirt, and I'm sorry, but not only is that not you, he doesn't deserve that. God, I wish they knew another song!",

        "RORY: I don't wanna talk to you about this anymore.",

Maybe we could really be a family, in the stupid, traditional \u0091Dan Quayle, golden retriever, grow old together, wear matching jogging suits' kind of way. And then he did get it together \u0096 he became that guy. . . and he gets to be that guy with her. Chris is gonna have a baby with his girlfriend. He's gonna marry her. . .and he's gonna be there for her while she's pregnant and he's gonna be there with her while her child grows up, and he's gonna be there for her while she does. . . whatever it is she does.
