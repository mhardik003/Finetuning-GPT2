        "[Lorelai and Rory are walking down the street toward the diner]",
        "LORELAI: And the rabbit says, \u0091How about that schnitzel!' Well?",
        "RORY: Well what? There's no punchline.",
        "LORELAI: That is the punchline.",
        "RORY: \u0091How about that schnitzel!' \u0096 that's the punchline?",
        "LORELAI: Well, no, not when you say it like that.",
        "RORY: How am I supposed to say it?",
        "LORELAI: Like a punchline.",
        "RORY: How about that schnitzel!",
        "LORELAI: Oh, forget it.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: You ruined my joke.",
        "RORY: Um, no, the punchline ruined your joke.",
        "LORELAI: Ha!",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: You admit it's a punchline.",
        "RORY: Oh my God.",
        "LORELAI: Ha, I am vindicated. \u0091How about that schnitzel!' has officially been declared a punchline.",
        "RORY: A really bad punchline.",
        "LORELAI: No one asked for the Norton Critical Edition. All the schnitzel and I wanted was some recognition and now we have it.",
        "[they walk into Luke's Diner]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, man, it's packed in here.",
        "RORY: I guess we counter it.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I guess we do.",
        "[they sit down at the counter]",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: What do you know, your face really can freeze that way.",
        "RORY: Are you okay?",
        "LUKE: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm great. It's a big fat happy sunshine day for me.",
        "LORELAI: Business looks good.",
        "RORY: Yeah, the place is packed.",
        "LUKE: Sure, it's been taken over by the J. Crew catalog.",
        "[Several families with little kids are seated at the tables]",
        "RORY: Oh, look, babies!",
        "LORELAI: I never wanna hear that come out of your mouth again.",
        "WOMAN: Find the yellow ball.",
        "MAN: [searching through a diaper bag] Yellow ball, yellow ball, yellow ball. . .ah, yellow duck.",
        "WOMAN: Ball.",
        "MAN: Yellow ball, yellow ball, yellow ball.",
        "LUKE: Every weekend, the same stupid group comes in here and take up all my tables and every chair they can get their sticky hands on, and they do that. They sit, they stand, one person holds the kid, another person holds the kid.",
        "MAN 2: I've got Choo-Choo Joe.",
        "LUKE: This guy runs in and out and back and forth, the other guy never takes his head out of that stupid bag, the women can't figure out which kid is which, and they do it all morning long, and then order two iced teas to go, and that is it.",
        "LORELAI: I'm sure you're exaggerating.",
        "LUKE: I am not exaggerating.",
        "WOMAN 2: Oh god.",
        "LUKE: Oh, now, this is good, you see \u0096 Choo-Choo Joe will not be working.",
        "WOMAN 2: Get the Bongo Bear. Get the Bongo Bear.",
        "RORY: How'd you know that?",
        "LUKE: Because Joe has not been working for the last six months. Personally, I don't think he's broken, I think he killed himself to get away from that family.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, now that kid's a major drooler.",
        "RORY: Yeah, it's like a fountain.",
        "LUKE: Okay, that's it, they have to go.",
        "LORELAI: Luke, come on, it's just spit. Pretend you're at a baseball game.",
        "LUKE: No no no, I've had enough. Let them go not spend money at Al's, I'm through.",
        "[He starts to walk toward the people when a woman stands up and starts unbuttoning her shirt. Luke walks back to Lorelai and Rory]",
        "LUKE: Is that woman doing what I think she's doing?",
        "[the woman has started nursing her baby]",
        "LORELAI: Um, well, I can't be a hundred percent sure, but. . .oh yeah, that's lunch.",
        "LUKE: Why, why do they do this? This is a public place, people are eating here.",
        "RORY: They sure are.",
        "LUKE: This cannot be sanitary.",
        "LORELAI: I agree. You don't know where that thing's been.",
        "LUKE: When did that become acceptable? In the old days, a woman would never consider doing that in public. They'd go find a barn or a cave or something. I mean, it's indecent. This is a diner not a peep show!",
        "LORELAI: Hey, consider making it a combo. You could charge more for your cheeseburgers. Of course, no one would ever feel the same ordering a glass of milk again, but . . .",
        "LUKE: I have to do something. I just can't stand here and let the lactating continue.",
        "LORELAI: Luke.",
        "RORY: Gross!",
        "LUKE: I'm gross? I'm not the one exposing myself for the entire world to see. That's it.",
        "[Luke starts to walk over to the woman, then walks back to the counter]",
        "LUKE: You go make her stop.",
        "LORELAI: I'm not going over there.",
        "LUKE: Why not? You're a woman.",
        "LORELAI: So what?",
        "LUKE: So you have the same parts.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "LUKE: You shouldn't be scared of it.",
        "LORELAI: Scared of it? You know, you're gonna be a bachelor for a really long time.",
        "LUKE: I am being taken advantage of here, and I do not like being taken advantage of. I hate this!",
        "[Jess walks down into the diner and sees the woman nursing]",
        "JESS: Oh geez!",
        "[Jess quickly turns around and walks back upstairs]",
        "LUKE: Okay, well, that was kind of fun.",
        "[opening credits]",
        "CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN",
        "[Lorelai walks into the lobby as Michel walks in from another direction carrying some pillows]",
        "LORELAI: Aw, is it your nap time?",
        "MICHEL: The Tylers in twelve asked to have their toxic pillows removed.",
        "LORELAI: Our pillows aren't toxic.",
        "MICHEL: According to the complimentary travel magazine that we put in their room, down pillows can carry airborne diseases and mold.",
        "LORELAI: Unbelievable \u0096 I didn't think anyone ever read those magazines.",
        "MICHEL: I think she had to, there was a picture of a roast chicken on the cover.",
        "LORELAI: Michel.",
        "MICHEL: She is large.",
        "LORELAI: Michel.",
        "MICHEL: And her husband in ugly.",
        "LORELAI: Hey!",
        "MICHEL: They threw pillows at me!",
        "[phone rings]",
        "LORELAI: Independence inn.",
        "EMILY: You really should identify yourself when you answer the phone at work.",
        "LORELAI: Sorry. Independence Inn, major disappointment speaking. Better?",
        "EMILY: Yes, thank you. Now I wanna talk to you about something.",
        "LORELAI: Shoot.",
        "EMILY: I'm in charge of the Society Matron's League's annual antique auction next Tuesday and I thought maybe you'd like to come.",
        "LORELAI: Society Matron's League? That's quite a name.",
        "EMILY: And what is wrong with that name, Lorelai?",
        "LORELAI: Nothing, it just sounds so serious. Brings to mind a room full of old ladies wearing black dresses and cameos and pushing spoonfuls of cod liver oil on the kids.",
        "EMILY: That's a very flattering portrait of my friends you're painting.",
        "LORELAI: I didn't mean your friends. I meant the other old ladies in the league, the ones who don't like you and your friends \u0091cause you guys are so young.",
        "EMILY: Kindly wrap this up soon, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Consider it wrapped.",
        "EMILY: Thank you. As I was saying, all the proceeds from the auction go to the children's hospital, and we're going to be offering some lovely pieces which I think would like very nice in that inn of yours.",
        "LORELAI: What sort of pieces?",
        "EMILY: Basically a lot canes and shawls, a couple of walkers. I believe we finally talked Old Lady Rollins into giving up her teeth.",
        "LORELAI: What sort of pieces, Mom?",
        "EMILY: We have a couple of wonderful writing desks, and some French end tables, rocking chairs, picture frames, lamps, davenports.",
        "LORELAI: Well",
        "EMILY: The worst that can happen is you won't find anything you like and you've wasted a couple of hours. And who knows, you might find something you love. Plus, I will be way too busy to sit with you if that is of concern.",
        "LORELAI: That is not a concern. Define \u0091way too busy.'",
        "EMILY: Are you interested or not?",
        "LORELAI: When is this auction?",
        "EMILY: Tuesday at one o'clock.",
        "LORELAI: I'll think about it.",
        "EMILY: I'll see you Tuesday.",
        "LORELAI: Bye. [hangs up]",
        "MICHEL: I'm sorry, did I hear you mention something about an auction?",
        "LORELAI: Uh, my mother's women's group is having one next week.",
        "MICHEL: Oh, well, you know \u0096 I love a good auction. The drama, the strategy.",
        "LORELAI: The strategy?",
        "MICHEL: Oh, yes. First, you mustn't be too eager because that drives the price way up.",
        "LORELAI: Don't be too eager, got it.",
        "MICHEL: And you must always be extremely careful of your paddle movements.",
        "LORELAI: Well, that certainly calls for a \"Dirty!\"",
        "MICHEL: Mm, how's your arm raise? Good?",
        "LORELAI: Pretty good.",
        "MICHEL: Ah, I have an excellent arm raise.",
        "LORELAI: That's what it says on the bathroom wall.",
        "MICHEL: Yes, well, if you need some tips. . .",
        "LORELAI: I'll give you a call.",
        "MICHEL: Good. Take me to the auction!",
        "LORELAI: Michel.",
        "MICHEL: Take me, I insist you take me!",
        "LORELAI: You don't even know if it's gonna be any good. It's just a bunch of society women.",
        "MICHEL: If your mother's involved, it will be impeccable and I haven't been to an impeccable auction in over a year.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I don't know.",
        "MICHEL: What do you want?",
        "LORELAI: Michel, I don't want anything.",
        "MICHEL: Stop playing coy with me. I want into that auction, you name your price.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, you have to work weekends for the rest of this month.",
        "MICHEL: Done.",
        "LORELAI: And you have to answer the phone when it rings.",
        "MICHEL: Done.",
        "LORELAI: And you have to answer it in English, unless the person is actually foreign.",
        "MICHEL: Done.",
        "LORELAI: And you have to oversee the nature hikers next week.",
        "MICHEL: No.",
        "LORELAI: Michel, if you wanna go to this auction, you have to be in the lobby at six o'clock Friday morning. You have to hand out towels and water bottles, you have to show them the hiking trails, and you have to let them give you a nature name.",
        "MICHEL: Fine, I will let them give me a nature name.",
        "LORELAI: All right, then, you can come.",
        "MICHEL: Thank you.",
        "LORELAI: Buttercup.",
        "MICHEL: You cannot give them suggestions!",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT YARD",
        "[Lorelai and Rory get out of the Jeep; Lorelai is carrying a pizza, Rory is carrying a brown takeout bag]",
        "RORY: I can't believe you got into a fight with Pete.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, you do not suddenly decide that garlic is an extra topping, not after five years, not after all we've been through. We single-handedly helped Pete pay for that new delivery truck of his, and I thought he needed to be reminded of that fact.",
        "RORY: Very loudly.",
        "LORELAI: Not that loudly.",
        "RORY: Dogs started barking.",
        "LORELAI: Because they heard about the garlic incident, and no one likes getting screwed, Rory, not even a Schnauzer. Pete's a swindler. He takes advantage of single mothers and their innocent children and for that, he must pay \u0096 what?",
        "RORY: He gave us free cheesy bread.",
        "LORELAI: He did? Oh!",
        "RORY: Yeah.",
        "LORELAI: I love the cheesy bread.",
        "RORY: I know you do.",
        "LORELAI: It's all hot, too.",
        "RORY: Now doesn't someone feel a little silly?",
        "LORELAI: Me?",
        "RORY: Should we call Pete tonight?",
        "LORELAI: Okay, after cheesy bread.",
        "RORY: Fine, after the cheesy bread.",
        "LORELAI: I'm gonna go get the mail \u0096 go on inside.",
        "RORY: Okay, I'm gonna go melt some more cheese on the pizza.",
        "LORELAI: Melt away.",
        "[Rory goes inside. Lorelai walks to the mailbox as a man walks across the yard]",
        "DWIGHT: Hey! Hello there, neighbor!",
        "LORELAI: Hi. I'm sorry, are we neighbors?",
        "DWIGHT: Yes, yes we are. I just moved in across the way.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, Beenie Morrison's old place.",
        "DWIGHT: That's right, Beenie Morrison's old place.",
        "LORELAI: Aw.",
        "DWIGHT: Beenie Morrison's old place. I live in Beenie Morrison's old place. Isn't that great?",
        "LORELAI: Only if Beenie Morrison didn't want to live there anymore.",
        "DWIGHT: Oh no, I paid him a very good price. Overpaid, actually, but it was worth it. I've been dreaming about a place like Beenie Morrison's old place for a long time, and then I found it. I'm sorry, I'm just really excited.",
        "LORELAI: That's okay, it's nice.",
        "DWIGHT: It's a great neighborhood.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, it is.",
        "DWIGHT: Everyone's so friendly. Babette \u0096 do you know Babette?",
        "LORELAI: Everybody knows Babette.",
        "DWIGHT: Oh, she's a great lady. Oh, uh, anyhow, I'm Dwight.",
        "LORELAI: I'm Lorelai. And if you see a teen walking around with a halo and a book, that's my daughter Rory.",
        "DWIGHT: Very nice to meet you, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Nice to meet you too, Dwight. Welcome to the neighborhood. If there's anything I can do to help out, let me know.",
        "DWIGHT: Really?",
        "LORELAI: Sure.",
        "DWIGHT: Well, that's great. Actually, I have this little favor I'd love to ask.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, right now?",
        "DWIGHT: Well, this week. You know, I just got this beautiful lawn put in, really amazing shade of green, and the guy who put it in for me, he told me that I have to keep each bade of grass very moist for the first few days while the roots take, but I have to go on a business trip for a few days. Huh, last minute, and believe me, I tried to get out of it but my boss said, \u0091Dwight, get off your keister and go make us some money', so I gotta go.",
        "LORELAI: Well, sure, when the word keister's being thrown around, what are you gonna do?",
        "DWIGHT: Exactly. So I was wondering if maybe you could water my lawn?",
        "LORELAI: Oh.",
        "DWIGHT: Only for a few days. You know, a little in the morning, a little in the late afternoon or evening, depending on your schedule. It would be a really big favor.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, well, I guess, I could water your lawn, Dwight \u0096 sure.",
        "DWIGHT: Boy, that is something. If I would have asked somebody back where I used to live to water my lawn, I would've gotten a much more HBO kind of answer. I love it here! Uh, so, uh, can you come on over now?",
        "LORELAI: Excuse me?",
        "DWIGHT: So I can show you where the on/off nozzle is. It'll only take a second.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, my daughter's waiting inside for me, I \u0096",
        "DWIGHT: Oh, uh, well, we can do it tomorrow before I leave.",
        "LORELAI: Great. What time are you leaving tomorrow?",
        "DWIGHT: Six a.m.",
        "LORELAI: Now sounds fine.",
        "DWIGHT: That's so terrific. Uh, follow me.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "[Lorelai follows Dwight across the yard]",
        "DWIGHT: You just gotta go over here and make a right.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. Oh, yeah, I know where it is.",
        "CUT TO DWIGHT'S FRONT YARD",
        "[Lorelai follows Dwight up the front pathway of his house]",
        "DWIGHT: Welcome to The Oasis! That's what I named this place, The Oasis, my oasis, a little slice of heaven right here on Earth. Gosh, I swear, I still can't believe I'm here. I was in a terrible marriage, you know.",
        "LORELAI: Actually, I didn't.",
        "DWIGHT: Oh, yeah, horrible, like a punishment out of Greek mythology. The women had five heads, suffering, agony. You know, I used to be taller?",
        "LORELAI: Really, she shrunk you?",
        "DWIGHT: I used to have more hair, too.",
        "LORELAI: Uh huh.",
        "DWIGHT: And higher arches.",
        "LORELAI: Wow.",
        "DWIGHT: But through all the screaming and the name calling, the berating and the humiliation, somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew someday I would have it \u0096 my oasis. Oh, that's what got me through. That's what kept me from sticking my head through a plate glass window every night when I got home.",
        "LORELAI: Well, that's a really nice story, Dwight. It's very inspiring and. . .oh, hey, this looks like it does something.",
        "DWIGHT: Huh? Oh, uh, yeah, this is the on/off spigot.",
        "LORELAI: Aha.",
        "DWIGHT: You just turn it to the right for on.",
        "LORELAI: Oh.",
        "DWIGHT: And the left for off.",
        "LORELAI: Seems simple.",
        "DWIGHT: It's very simple.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, so, twice a day.",
        "DWIGHT: Yeah, for a good fifteen minute soaking.",
        "LORELAI: I will soak my best.",
        "DWIGHT: I really appreciate it.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, well, you have a good trip.",
        "DWIGHT: I owe ya.",
        "[Lorelai walks back to her house; Rory is waiting on the porch]",
        "RORY: Where have you been?",
        "LORELAI: Get in the house.",
        "RORY: I thought you were gonna go get the mail.",
        "LORELAI: Go, go, go!",
        "RORY: What are you doing?",
        "LORELAI: Don't look around, stare straight ahead, no more talking to people ever!",
        "RORY: Mom!",
        "[Lorelai pushes Rory into the house]",
        "CUT TO AUCTION",
        "[An auctioneer stands on a stage running the auction; Lorelai and Michel are sitting in the audience.]",
        "AUCTIONEER: Next up, we have an occasional table from a distinguished, family-owned company in Vermont, circa 1912. We shall start the bidding at two hundred-fifty dollars. Do I hear two-fifty? Two hundred fifty, thank you.",
        "LORELAI: Wow, lots of garbage at these things.",
        "MICHEL: Always. You've got to be patient and wait for what you want to appear, then pounce.",
        "LORELAI: Hm, true at an auction, true at a singles bar.",
        "MICHEL: To put it crudely, yes.",
        "LORELAI: Crap, crap, crap that makes the previous two items not seem like crap.",
        "MICHEL: Could you keep your crap commentaries to yourself?",
        "AUCTIONEER: Four hundred dollars, we have four hundred, four hundred \u0096 going once, going twice, sold to bidder number sixty-five.",
        "LORELAI: Aw, wow, that was a good table.",
        "MICHEL: It was a good table, not a great table.",
        "LORELAI: We should've gone for it.",
        "MICHEL: Too expensive and too many scratches.",
        "LORELAI: We could've buffed the scratches out.",
        "MICHEL: Look, if you want it that bad, it's quite obvious that the buyer's children will be selling it at his probate in the very near future.",

        "[Emily walks over to them]",

        "EMILY: Yes, from the inn.",
        "MICHEL: Hello Mrs. Gilmore.",
        "EMILY: Didn't you see me waving at you before?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "EMILY: You didn't wave back.",
        "LORELAI: It's dangerous to wave at an auction. You didn't see before, but when you waved you bought a motorcycle and a sidecar.",
        "EMILY: I did not.",
        "LORELAI: Circa 1912. Now would you drive it or would you sit in the sidecar?",
        "[A woman walks up to them]",
        "NATALIE: There she is, the Cobra.",
        "EMILY: Oh, now, Natalie.",
        "LORELAI: The what?",
        "NATALIE: This woman gets her way or she squeezes \u0091til you comply.",
        "LORELAI: Like a superhero.",
        "EMILY: Ignore her, Natalie is just being Natalie. My daughter, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Nice to meet you.",
        "NATALIE: Your mother's got such spunk. You must love her.",
        "LORELAI: I think she'd squeeze me to death if I didn't.",
        "EMILY: Natalie, you're embarrassing me.",
        "NATALIE: Oh, hush, Emily. Listen to this. . . our auctioneer calls in sick this morning, they are such flakes, and what is an auction without an auctioneer?",
        "LORELAI: Just a bunch of nuts with paddles surrounded by mismatched furniture?",

Good question. Well, I don't know his name because I only knew him by his nickname. . .Uh, Shamu. We called him Shamu. He was kind of, um, a big guy in high school, but he's slimmed down quite a bit. . .No, see, I don't have time to contact the high school alumni committee because time is of the essence. . . See, Shamu and I went to a liquor store after the auction and we bought a lottery ticket together and we tore it and I took half and he took half, and I'll be damned if the thing didn't win! . . .Fourteen million dollars! . . .Really, but see, we have to claim it by four p.m. today or we forfeit. . .Ah, yes. . .Oh, well, but there's one more thing that I forgot to tell you. See, um, my blood type is o-negative and he's o-negative and I have a medical condition that. . .All right, then. Well, thank you anyway. Bye. [hangs up]",

Good question. Well, I don't know his name because I only knew him by his nickname. . .Uh, Shamu. We called him Shamu. He was kind of, um, a big guy in high school, but he's slimmed down quite a bit. . .No, see, I don't have time to contact the high school alumni committee because time is of the essence. . . See, Shamu and I went to a liquor store after the auction and we bought a lottery ticket together and we tore it and I took half and he took half, and I'll be damned if the thing didn't win! . . .Fourteen million dollars! . . .Really, but see, we have to claim it by four p.m. today or we forfeit. . .Ah, yes. . .Oh, well, but there's one more thing that I forgot to tell you.
