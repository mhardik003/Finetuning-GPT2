        "[The four Gilmores are seated at the table. The maid serves dinner.]",
        "LORELAI: Don't tell me this is what it looks like.",
        "EMILY: It's escargot.",
        "LORELAI: Ugh. That's what it looks like.",
        "RORY: Snails?",
        "EMILY: Escargot.",
        "LORELAI: Slimy thing by any other name...",
        "RICHARD: They taste like garlic and butter.",
        "LORELAI: Don't say \"they.\" Food should not have pronouns.",
        "RICHARD: Give it a try.",
        "LORELAI: But if I do and we're having road kill for the main course, then I will already have used up my allotment of gross-out food for the day, so I'll abstain.",
        "RICHARD: I guess we should strike escargot off the list of Friday night dinner foods.",
        "EMILY: Sweetie loved escargot. That's funny how we remember those things.",
        "RICHARD: Hm.",
        "LORELAI: Sweetie?",
        "RORY: Sweetie who?",
        "EMILY: Sweetie Nelson, one of my oldest friends. She passed away yesterday.",
        "RORY: Oh, I'm sorry, Grandma.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, I've heard you mention her.",
        "RORY: Was she sick?",
        "EMILY: She'd been ill for some time, but still...",
        "RICHARD: The family is pretty overwhelmed.",
        "EMILY: By the way, Davis called late today. The funeral is going to be Sunday.",
        "LORELAI: Was that her real name -- Sweetie?",
        "EMILY: No, her name was Melinda. Sweetie was a nickname.",
        "LORELAI: Why?",
        "EMILY: What do you mean, why?",
        "LORELAI: I mean, how did they get Sweetie from Melinda?",
        "EMILY: They didn't get Sweetie from Melinda. Sweetie is a nickname.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I know Sweetie was a nickname, but usually, a nickname comes from a version of your name, or there's a story behind the name or something.",
        "EMILY: She was sweet. That's the story.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "EMILY: She had a very sweet nature.",
        "LORELAI: Hm.",
        "EMILY: Well, what kind of story did you want, Lorelai?",
        "LORELAI: No, that's fine. She was sweet. They called her Sweetie. It's a good story.",
        "EMILY: No, really. Exactly what kind of story about my recently departed friend would amuse you?",
        "LORELAI: Mom, it's not to amuse me. It's --",
        "EMILY: All right, fine. Sweetie's father was a very poor man -- so poor that Sweetie and her four siblings all had to sleep in a hollowed-out tree trunk because the house was only big enough for their parents. One winter, there was no food, so Sweetie crawled out of her trunk, wrapped her feet in newspaper, and walked forty miles in the snow to the nearest town, where she stumbled into a candy store. The owner took pity on her and gave her bags of candy, a dill pickle, and drove her back to her family. He promptly offered a job to her father, who gladly accepted and eventually owned that store and turned it into one of the most important candy emporiums in the world. And that is how she got the name Sweetie. There, how was that?",
        "LORELAI: Now, that was a pretty good story.",
        "RICHARD: I'm sorry, Emily, did you say the funeral is Sunday?",
        "EMILY: Yes. Is that a problem?",
        "RICHARD: Well, Mr. Hamoto is in town, and Jason has set up golf for him, and then there's lunch after that. What time is the service?",
        "EMILY: Noon.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, noon. That's cutting it very close. How important is it for me to be at the funeral?",
        "EMILY: Not important at all.",
        "RICHARD: Well, fine, then. Be sure to give them my condolences.",
        "EMILY: Of course. Eat your food.",
        "LORELAI: [Gasps] I think one of them is still alive.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai!",
        "LORELAI: No, seriously. He was over near the radish like five minutes ago.",

        "KIRK: This doesn't smell right.",
        "LANE: Smells fine, Kirk.",
        "KIRK: I think the eggs were bad.",
        "LANE: The eggs are fine, Kirk.",
        "KIRK: Were they cooked in the fish pan? They smell like they were cooked in the fish pan.",
        "LANE: No, the eggs were not cooked in the fish pan. They were cooked in the egg pan.",
        "KIRK: Was the fish pan sitting next to the egg pan? Because perhaps -",
        "[Lorelai walks in the door.]",
        "LORELAI: I need something with cheese!",
        "KIRK: Lorelai, smell my eggs.",
        "LORELAI: Not today, Kirk. Hey, where's Luke? I want him to make that breakfast quesadilla thing he made yesterday.",
        "LANE: Luke's not here.",
        "LORELAI: Where is he? He knows the exact right jack-to-cheddar ratio.",
        "KIRK: He's out there. [Kirk points out the window.]",
        "LORELAI: Where?",
        "KIRK: Over there with Nicole.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, looks like a serious talk.",
        "KIRK: And there have been zero light moments.",
        "LORELAI: I wish I knew what they were talking about.",
        "KIRK: Oh, I can tell you what they're saying.",
        "LORELAI: How?",
        "KIRK: I read lips. My girlfriend taught me. It's so we can have quiet time and keep the conversation going at the same time. Okay, she just said, \"Hardwood sponge is the authority of the hostile biographer.\" And then he responded, \"Just phone cords to original samovars.\"",
        "LORELAI: Kirk, that doesn't make any sense.",
        "KIRK: Must mean they're on to us and they've switched to some sort of code.",
        "LORELAI: I don't think they're speaking in code.",
        "KIRK: Oh, I think Luke's heading back. He just got up and said, \"Feel your taters.\"",
        "LORELAI: Is it possible he said, \"I'll see you later?\"",
        "KIRK: No, I'm pretty sure about this one.",
        "LANE: Kirk, I'm so sorry, we accidentally made the eggs in the fish pan. Here's new eggs.",
        "KIRK: I don't know why everybody in this town always thinks I'm crazy.",
        "CUT TO YALE NEWSROOM",
        "RORY: You've got to be kidding.",
        "DOYLE: I certainly am not kidding. This is serious.",
        "RORY: It's not plagiarism.",
        "DOYLE: Hey! Do you also like to shout \"fire\" in a crowded theater? This is a newsroom. Do not use the \"p\" word.",
        "RORY: Every single word in my piece was written by me.",
        "DOYLE: Was it? Look at this. \"Small band of followers.\" \"Rain-soaked highway.\" I've seen both of those before.",
        "RORY: Of course you've seen them before. Those are phrases used to talk about a small band of followers or, you know, a rain-soaked highway. They're not even clich\u00e9s like \"shouting fire in a crowded theater.\"",
        "DOYLE: I'm sorry, can you say \"Stephen Glass?\" The entire climate of journalistic ethics is under a microscope right now. We can't afford anything that looks shady. I'd rather not have Tobey Maguire playing me in a movie about the Yale Daily News scandal, thank you very much.",
        "RORY: I get that, but I don't think my \"rain-soaked highway\" looks shady.",
        "DOYLE: [Scoffs] Typical. It's your attitude.",
        "RORY: What attitude?",
        "DOYLE: Look around this room. People writing their anthro papers on our computers, people Xeroxing their phone bills on our copy machines. No one's running, no one's sweating. Every single person in this room looks extremely well-rested. No one spell-checks. No one fact-checks. This is the breeding ground for the next Jayson Blair! Fix it. And tidy up your desk!",
        "[Doyle stomps away.]",
        "GLENN: And my month is up.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "GLENN: You're the new dog to kick around here. I feel bad, 'cause you tend to be a pretty decent person, but my nose has been whacked with a newspaper so many times this month, it almost makes me miss my mother.",
        "RORY: Doyle's just in a bad mood, that's all.",
        "DOYLE: \"Herd mentality?\" Are you freaking kidding me?!",
        "GLENN: Welcome to the dollhouse.",

        "[Lorelai and Sookie are sitting at the table going over paperwork. Michel is seated on the floor in front of the TV.]",
        "LORELAI: Michel, come on, we've got to get into these budgets.",
        "SOOKIE: Now.",
        "MICHEL: Does the red light mean it's programmed?",
        "SOOKIE: I explained it a hundred times.",
        "LORELAI: Michel, you've been setting that machine for 20 minutes now.",
        "SOOKIE: The man can't live without his dog show.",
        "MICHEL: Ugh. I could just kill my cable provider. \"No Westminster dog show, but please enjoy Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle 24 hours a day.\" Ah, there, it's recording.",
        "LORELAI: Well, get over here.",
        "MICHEL: I just want to see the Chows. [Laughs] Look at that one strut. [Baby talk to the TV.] You know you're a pretty girl, don't you? Yes, with those \"I need some loving\" eyes.",
        "SOOKIE: Is he doing tricks?",
        "LORELAI: It sounds like they're turning them. [Lorelai's cell phone rings.] Hello.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai, it's me. Do you have a moment?",
        "LORELAI: Uh, sure.",
        "EMILY: Your grandmother. She's gone.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "EMILY: Last night. She apparently had a heart attack. The maid found her in the morning.",
        "LORELAI: But I didn't even know her heart was a thing. Was her heart a thing? Did we know that?",
        "EMILY: No, it was quite unexpected. There wasn't any warning at all.",
        "LORELAI: But we just - we just saw her.",
        "EMILY: I know. It's a complete shock.",
        "LORELAI: Ohh. I -- how is Dad?",
        "EMILY: He's completely fallen apart. From the moment he heard the news, he's been almost incoherent.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no.",
        "EMILY: He's in his office now with the Scotch, and he wants turtleneck soup -- asks for it over and over.",
        "LORELAI: What's turtleneck soup?",
        "EMILY: Apparently something his mother used to have made for him when he was a little boy, and now he wants some, and I can't seem to find anybody who has any idea what it is.",
        "MICHEL: All right, the pugs are up next. They're ugly. Let's do this.",
        "LORELAI: [Whispers to Michel] My grandmother.",
        "SOOKIE: [Whispers] Heart attack -- grandmother.",
        "MICHEL: [Whispers] What?",
        "LORELAI: Dead grandmother, Michel. Mom, have you looked on the internet?",
        "EMILY: For what?",
        "LORELAI: For turtleneck soup. You could Google it.",
        "EMILY: Can I? Can I Google it?",
        "LORELAI: Okay, never mind. Sookie, do you have any idea what turtleneck soup could be?",
        "EMILY: You mean mock turtle soup?",
        "LORELAI: Mom, do you think he means \"mock turtle soup?\"",
        "EMILY: Maybe that's what he said. Is there such a thing?",
        "LORELAI: I think so. [to Sookie] Can you make mock turtle soup?",
        "SOOKIE: I never tried, but I think I have a recipe for it somewhere here.",
        "LORELAI: So, Mom, Sookie's tracking down the soup. What else can I do?",
        "EMILY: Nothing. If you can find the soup, that'll be enough. You'll tell Rory?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, I'll tell Rory.",
        "EMILY: All right, I have to go. Your grandmother left very specific instructions on exactly how she wants her funeral to be, so I have a hundred things to do.",
        "LORELAI: I'll be there with the soup as soon as I can, Mom.",
        "EMILY: All right, bye.",
        "LORELAI: Bye. [Hangs up] I'm gonna have to go.",
        "SOOKIE: No problem. One huge vat of mock turtle soup coming up.",
        "MICHELL: Do you need a hug?",
        "LORELAI: Thanks, I'm okay. I have to call Rory. You'll call me when the soup's ready?",
        "SOOKIE: I'm on it.",
        "LORELAI: Have to go. Michel, you'll take care of the papers and the landscaping plans?",
        "MICHEL: Yes, I will. Go, go.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. Purse, coat, keys. I'm gone. Michel?",
        "MICHEL: Yes?",
        "LORELAI: [Sighs] I think I'll take that hug now. [They hug then step back.] A little weird, huh?",
        "MICHEL: Yeah, extremely.",
        "LORELAI: Heart in the right place, but never again?",
        "MICHEL: Thank God.",
        "CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE",
        "[Emily is on the phone.]",
        "EMILY: Yes, I understand the reverend's retired. You said that four times. But my mother-in-law specifically requested him for the service, and... [The doorbell rings.] Well, isn't there any forwarding information?",
        "[Emily opens the door for Lorelai.]",
        "LORELAI: I got the soup.",
        "EMILY: Well, I will hold while you look. [to Lorelai] Thank God. He's in his study. Take that into him and see if you can get him to eat. [to person on the phone] Yes, I'm still here. Miraculous, isn't it? A phone number! How...",
        "[Lorelai goes into Richard's study. He's lying on the leather couch with a drink in his hand.]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, dad.",
        "RICHARD: Lorelai?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, uh...I have something for you. Mock turtle soup.",
        "RICHARD: Mock turtle soup?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. Sookie made it.",
        "RICHARD: Mock turtle soup. [ Chuckling ] Mock turtle soup. [ Voice breaking ] Mock turtle soup. [ Crying ] Mock turtle soup.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, hey, soup's gone. No soup here. Who mentioned soup? This is definitely a no-soup zone. Uh, the music's nice.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, she loved Kay Kyser. She wasn't really a musical woman. Music was a little frivolous for her. But Kay Kyser.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. Well, she's great.",
        "RICHARD: Kay Kyser's a man.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, well, his parents had an ugly sense of humor then. [Richard sobs.] Oh, boy.",
        "RICHARD: She was a saint -- the woman was a saint.",
        "LORELAI: Here, Dad.",
        "RICHARD: I learned everything from that woman. \"Life is a battle, and you either enter it armed or you surrender immediately.\" That is what she told me...on my 10th birthday. I never forgot that. No, no one...was as strong as that woman. That wonderful woman...that saint of a woman.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Dad.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine. I -- I just have to deal with this... [Sighs] regret.",
        "LORELAI: What regret? Dad, you and Gran were so close.",
        "RICHARD: The last words we exchanged, we exchanged in anger.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, but, dad, that's -",
        "RICHARD: I lost my temper and I was disrespectful. And that's the way -- that's the way it ended. With an argument and hateful words.",
        "LORELAI: Dad, you know, that was one little fight. I mean, one little fight between you and Gran doesn't wipe away years of -",
        "RICHARD: That woman raised me and she taught me. And she took care of the family even after Father died. And I spoke her as if I owed her nothing, as if she was like anyone else in the world and not the saint of a woman that she was.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Dad.",
        "RICHARD: You only have one set of parents, Lorelai. Remember that. I forgot and now I have to live with that for the rest of my life. [ Sighs ] You mentioned soup.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RICHARD: When you came in.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, soup. I have soup. Um, Mom mentioned that you were talking about mock turtle soup and you really should eat something, Dad.",
        "RICHARD: I need a spoon.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, my Go-- yes, I'll get you a spoon. I'll get you -- you just sit right there. I'll be right back with your spoon.",
        "[Lorelai goes back out to the living room where Emily is on the phone.]",
        "EMILY: [talking on the phone] But it used to be Martelli's Florist, yes? Okay, do you have any idea where Martelli's moved to? Oh, well, before he died, did Mr. Martelli pass his trade on to any of the other Martellis? Yes, I'll hold. [to Lorelai] How is he doing?",
        "LORELAI: He needs a spoon.",
        "EMILY: He's going to eat?",
        "LORELAI: He's going to eat.",
        "EMILY: Thank God. Take an apple. See if you can get him to eat an apple. [into the phone] I'm here. Yes, I will take the simple stepson's number. Thank you. I will speak slowly. Thank you. [hangs up] Not that one. And take some bread, too.",
        "LORELAI: How are the arrangements coming?",
        "EMILY: Well, she made them twenty years ago, so the reverend is retired, the florist has moved, and two of the pallbearers are no longer with us. Luckily, they both had sons who look remarkably like them, so I think we can get away with it.",
        "LORELAI: All right, I'm gonna bring this stuff to Dad.",
        "EMILY: I'm going to call the florist's idiot stepson.",
        "RICHARD: Emily? Emily!",
        "EMILY: I'm right here, Richard. What's wrong?",
        "RICHARD: This is outrageous! They've completely ruined it!",
        "EMILY: Who ruined what?",
        "RICHARD: Trix's obituary. The Courant just faxed it through. It's disgraceful! I'll sue them!",
        "EMILY: Just calm down.",
        "LORELAI: [taking the paper and reading] \"Lorelai Gilmore died this week at age 86. A member of the prominent Gilmore family and widow of Charles Abbott Gilmore, she is survived by a son, Richard Gilmore, and numerous other family members and devoted friends.\"",
        "EMILY: Well, it's -",
        "RICHARD: It's an insult! That's all they write? Nothing about her charity work or her collecting or her travels? And not a word about the new maternity wing that she donated to St. Joseph's! You tell me where all of the fine people of Hartford are supposed to have all their babies if it weren't for my mother, tell me that!",
        "EMILY: All right, all right, calm down. We will take care of it.",
        "RICHARD: She was a saint, that woman!",
        "EMILY: I know. Absolutely, we will make sure it says \"saint\" somewhere in the article.",
        "RICHARD: You're sure?",
        "LORELAI: Don't worry, Dad.",
        "RICHARD: Because it's very, very wrong!",
        "LORELAI: Dad, I got your spoon.",
        "RICHARD: Well, I'm not hungry. [leaves]",
        "EMILY: Wonderful. Yet another thing I have to take care of.",
        "LORELAI: Mom, why don't you let me help out a little?",
        "EMILY: That's all right.",
        "LORELAI: I'm happy to do it. I'll bring coffee, a Danish. You've never had so much fun with death in your life.",
        "EMILY: I appreciate the offer, but I have it all under control.",
        "LORELAI: I should probably take off then.",
        "EMILY: Goodbye. Thank Sookie for me. [picks up the phone and dials] Hello, I'm looking for Manny Martelli, please. Well, what time do you expect him back from the science-fiction convention? Yes. Would you hold on a minute, please? [to Lorelai] Lorelai, I have to go to Gran's house tomorrow to sort through her personal papers.",

        "LORELAI: Well, you didn't know her that well.",
        "RORY: Still, she was my great-grandmother. I mean, I should feel more. [gets more and more upset] Oh, God, what if I don't cry at the funeral? Then everyone will see that I'm not crying, and Grandpa will be upset.",
        "LORELAI: Well, honey, if you can't cry, at least you know you can work yourself up into a very respectable panic attack.",
        "RORY: It might have to do.",
        "LORELAI: You're an amazing kid. She was so lucky to have you as a great-granddaughter. Hey, do you want me to come by tonight, pick you up, take you to Tijuana, get you drunk and laid?",

It's about this prostitute named Sugar in Victorian England. She starts rising through the ranks of society, and she meets these really vivid characters!",

        "SHANNON: I don't -",

My grandmother, who wants fresh clothing and a 4,000-year-old minister, who wants to be cremated and put in a jar on top of my mother's mantelpiece to sit up there and judge for all eternity.

She can't see the mess she's left behind, so I'll just -- I'll take this.",

So if she has a problem with the size or the strawberry print, then she can rise from the dead and come back here and yell at me herself.

It was my first custom-made suit. I told your grandmother that it didn't fit anymore, but really, I just didn't want to see it again. And I suppose this is going to be it for this suit, too.",

One winter, there was no food, so Sweetie crawled out of her trunk, wrapped her feet in newspaper, and walked forty miles in the snow to the nearest town, where she stumbled into a candy store. The owner took pity on her and gave her bags of candy, a dill pickle, and drove her back to her family. He promptly offered a job to her father, who gladly accepted and eventually owned that store and turned it into one of the most important candy emporiums in the world.
