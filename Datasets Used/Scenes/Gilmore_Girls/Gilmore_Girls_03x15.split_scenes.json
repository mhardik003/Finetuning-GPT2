        "The Doose clan invades the Inn for their family reunion. Trix comes for a short visit and drives Emily crazy until Emily finally finds something scandalous to hold over Trix's head. Lane and Dave cook up a fake-date scheme with Young Chui to get Mrs. Kim to allow Lane to date Dave, but neither Young Chui's real girlfriend or Dave is immune to a little jealousy. The Stars Hollow High hockey team reaches the regional semifinals for the first time in 40 years and everyone not attending the monster truck rally turns out to cheer the team on and endure Kirk's hopelessly inept play-by-play. After Jess's too laid-back attitude about going out leaves Rory sitting home alone for most of the weekend, she takes Lorelai's advice and heads for the hockey game, where she discovers that Dean has a new girlfriend, Lindsay."

        "[Lorelai is sitting at a table with Taylor]",
        "TAYLOR: So, I have talked to every member of my family and we agreed that you can hold the rooms on my credit card, but everyone must check out with their own.",
        "LORELAI: Got it.",
        "TAYLOR: Have we gone over the room arrangements yet?",
        "LORELAI: Closing in on a hundred and fifty times.",
        "TAYLOR: Well, the Doose clan is very, very particular about their accommodations. We are light sleepers and are prone to night terrors, and several of us are very allergic to bed clothing, so it's very important that we are \u0096",
        "LORELAI: On the first floor or near a fire escape. Yes, Taylor, I know, it's all taken care of. Um, Taylor, could you just hang on a second? I'll be right back.",
        "TAYLOR: Oh, all right, but hurry. I don't have all day.",
        "[Lorelai walks to the counter where Rory is talking to Jess]",
        "LORELAI: Hey. You were supposed to bring me a cup of coffee.",
        "RORY: Yes, I know. I'm sorry, I got distracted.",
        "JESS: My fault.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, but see, when you left me there, I was alone, and now, look, I'm no longer alone.",
        "RORY: Taylor found you?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, and we've since embarked on hour one hundred millionth of planning the special Doose reunion.",
        "RORY: I'm coming back over there right now.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, and then you are going to get very sick and be unable to feed yourself so that Mommy will need to take you home and stay by your side until the Doose reunion is over.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. Say goodbye to Jess.",
        "RORY: Bye Jess.",
        "JESS: I'll call you later.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, limp a little if you can.",
        "RORY: Uh, what malady do I have that makes me limp and lose ability to feed myself?",
        "LORELAI: It's French.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "[they walk over to Taylor]",
        "LORELAI: Taylor, listen, we're gonna need to finish this up a little later. Rory's not feeling so good.",
        "TAYLOR: Oh no, what's the matter?",
        "RORY: It's French.",
        "TAYLOR: All right. Well, I think we're just about done here anyhow. Oh, before I forget, let me give you each one of these. [hands them each a button]",
        "RORY: [reads button] \"Stars Hollow Hockey, 2003 semifinalists. Go Minutemen. The future is yours. Bring this button to Doose's for fifty percent off your next purchase of Stove Top Stuffing.\" Wow, that's a lot of words for a tiny button.",
        "TAYLOR: I expect to see both of you wearing them at the game tomorrow night.",
        "LORELAI: Well, we'll try to make it.",
        "TAYLOR: Try to make it? My dear, do you realize that this is the first time we've been in the regional semifinals in forty-three years?",
        "RORY: But didn't we only make it this far because the Litchfield team got food poisoning?",
        "TAYLOR: Well, I admit it's not exactly the plot of Hoosiers, but still it's very, very exciting.",
        "LORELAI: Well, it's nice that you and your family are so loyal to the home team.",
        "TAYLOR: Oh, the Dooses have been the backbone of Stars Hollow High hockey for years. I, myself, was the goalkeeper for our team in the last regional finals.",
        "LORELAI: I did not know that.",
        "TAYLOR: Oh yes. I was responsible for the game-winning goal.",
        "LUKE: So the puck just ricocheted off your head and into the net?",
        "TAYLOR: Still counted.",
        "LUKE: For God's sake, I was making a joke. You really got pucked in the head?",
        "TAYLOR: No, I was making a joke, too. Uh, Lorelai, just one more \u0096",
        "[Taylor looks out the window and sees Lorelai and Rory running down the street]",
        "TAYLOR: What a disgrace, making that poor sick girl run.",
        "LUKE: Wow, you can see the dent.",
        "[opening credits]",
        "CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE",
        "[Lorelai, Rory, and Richard are eating dinner]",
        "RICHARD: So, Rory, how are things at Chilton?",
        "RORY: Great, great, everything's great.",
        "RICHARD: And, uh, Lorelai, things at the inn are good?",
        "LORELAI: Mm, mmhmm, hm.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, Rory, please slow down and chew your food properly.",
        "LORELAI: I'm always telling her that. Pass the butter.",
        "RORY: Pass the peas.",
        "LORELAI: Pass the pork.",
        "RORY: Pass your plate.",
        "RICHARD: I'm sorry, is there a race going on I don't know about?",
        "[Emily walks into the room]",
        "EMILY: That was your mother, Richard. She just wanted to make sure that all our towels are Egyptian cotton.",
        "RICHARD: Well, it's a simple question.",
        "EMILY: It's her fortieth simple question of the day.",
        "RICHARD: Well, she's going to be staying with us, Emily. She just wants to know she'll be comfortable.",
        "EMILY: Yes, because we usually give our guests the towels we've stolen from the Holiday Inn.",
        "RORY: Great Grandma's coming to stay with you?",
        "RICHARD: Just for a few days, um, while her floors are being redone.",
        "LORELAI: So, how's Gran doing?",
        "RORY: Yeah, does she miss London?",
        "EMILY: Not half as much as I do.",
        "RICHARD: Emily.",
        "EMILY: I never really truly appreciated the Atlantic Ocean before. Three thousand lovely miles of water.",
        "RICHARD: You are talking about my mother.",
        "EMILY: I know that, Richard. And I'm happy to have her stay here, but must she keep interrupting the one dinner a week that we have with Lorelai and Rory? She knows what time we dine \u0096 and why are you two eating so quickly?",
        "LORELAI: We're not eating quickly.",
        "RORY: Yeah, you've been on the phone for awhile. It probably just seems like we've eaten a lot.",
        "[phone rings]",
        "EMILY: I wonder who that could be.",
        "RICHARD: Emily.",
        "[doorbell rings]",
        "EMILY: Well, aren't we popular? Richard, perhaps you could get that while I have another bath sheet versus bath towel debate with your mother.",
        "[Richard and Emily leave the room]",
        "LORELAI: You're giving it away!",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: You're eating too quickly.",
        "RORY: What? You said that we had to be out of here by 8:30.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, but I didn't tell you to broadcast it.",
        "RORY: I'm eating at the same speed you are.",
        "LORELAI: But you're eating small bites very fast. You've gotta eat bigger bites at a normal speed.",
        "RORY: You mean I should risk choking so we can make our Friday night plans?",
        "LORELAI: Exactly.",
        "[Richard returns to the table]",
        "RICHARD: I apologize for that.",
        "LORELAI: Collection agency again?",
        "RICHARD: Excuse me?",
        "[Emily returns to the room]",
        "EMILY: Thank goodness she called. Richard, did you know people actually expect there to be soap in their bathrooms when they. . .",
        "[Emily hears a noise. She looks into the living room and sees two men carrying a mattress up the steps]",
        "EMILY: Why are there strange men hauling a mattress up my staircase?",
        "RICHARD: Well, now, Emily \u0096",
        "EMILY: She sent her own mattress?",
        "RICHARD: Well, she has a very sensitive back.",
        "EMILY: She sent her own mattress?",
        "RICHARD: I'll go and supervise. [leaves room]",
        "LORELAI: Well, Mom, it looks like you got a lot going on here.",
        "RORY: With the mattresses and the phone calls.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, so we're just gonna go and get out of your hair.",
        "EMILY: Hold it right there. What is going on with you two?",
        "LORELAI: What are you talking about?",
        "EMILY: You know exactly what I'm talking about. Bolting down your food, leaving before dessert, Rory checking her pager every five minutes. What do you have planned? Fine, we'll just sit here until one of you feels like filling me in.",
        "LORELAI: She has a date!",
        "RORY: So does she!",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, but hers starts a half-hour earlier than mine!",
        "RORY: Because you get to stay out later!",
        "LORELAI: Because I'm the mom!",
        "EMILY: You two, stop it right now! You're behaving like children.",
        "LORELAI: Sorry.",
        "RORY: Yeah, sorry.",
        "EMILY: Our deal is for Friday night dinners, not appearances at Friday night dinners. Now, you will sit there and you will eat your dessert.",
        "LORELAI: But \u0096",
        "EMILY: One more word and I throw in a game of charades.",
        "RORY: Yes, ma'am.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, Mom.",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai and Rory rush into the house]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, we gotta get a faster car!",
        "RORY: Hey, don't blame the car.",
        "LORELAI: So you're saying it's my fault we're late?",
        "RORY: Who was the one who said, \"Hey, I've got room for another piece of pie.\"",
        "[Lorelai goes upstairs]",
        "LORELAI: Ah! You kept making all that pointless conversation, all those thank you's and please's. What, are you running for Miss Congeniality?",
        "RORY: Just get ready.",
        "LORELAI: What time are you meeting Jess?",
        "RORY: I don't know, I'll tell you in a sec. [checks answering machine]",
        "LORELAI: Have you seen my brown boots? I cannot go out without those brown boots. My entire outfit was retrofitted around those practically \u0096 Oh! Wait, can you believe it? Hey, they were in my closet. What sort of bizarre accident of fate put them there?",
        "[Lorelai walks back downstairs]",
        "LORELAI: What? He didn't call? Well, maybe it's too early. What time is it?",
        "RORY: 9:15.",
        "LORELAI: And when did he say he would call?",
        "RORY: When he got off work.",
        "LORELAI: Which was when?",
        "RORY: It varies.",
        "LORELAI: I'm sorry, I thought you guys had a plan.",
        "RORY: We did.",
        "LORELAI: And the plan was that he calls you whenever because his work time varies?",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: Good plan. Bay of Pigs, was that yours, too?",
        "RORY: He'll call.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, look, you wanna come out with me and Alex? We might go see a midnight movie if something really bad is playing.",
        "RORY: No, thanks.",
        "LORELAI: Just promise me you won't sit here all night staring at the phone.",
        "RORY: [turns on TV] Happy?",
        "LORELAI: Delirious. Oh, I should not have had that second piece of pie.",
        "RORY: Full?",
        "LORELAI: No, just late.",
        "RORY: Bring me some Milk Duds.",
        "LORELAI: It's a plan!",
        "CUT TO OUTSIDE",
        "[Lorelai and Rory walk through the town square]",
        "RORY: Then I spent about forty minutes cleaning out my hard drive. You would not believe the amount of junk that accumulates \u0096 old files, things you've downloaded but never opened. It really slows down your CPU.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yeah, I hate a slow CPU.",
        "RORY: Then, all of a sudden, I looked down and I saw all this hair and dust between the keys of my keyboard.",
        "LORELAI: So, naturally, you cleaned your keyboard.",
        "RORY: Yes, and I'll tell you, it was a strangely satisfying experience.",
        "LORELAI: Uh huh. One question. During this time that you watched TV, did homework, proofread articles for The Franklin, organized my sock drawer, returned emails and gave a much needed cleaning to your computer, did it ever occur to you to call him?",
        "RORY: No.",
        "LORELAI: Why?",
        "RORY: Because he said he'd call me.",
        "LORELAI: Right. Okay, so then I'm guessing you're not gonna mention anything to him about your extremely productive evening alone when you see him either.",
        "RORY: Why should I?",
        "LORELAI: No reason I can think of.",
        "[They stop to look at Stars Hollow High, which has been toilet papered by a rival school]",
        "LORELAI: You know, I almost like it better like this.",
        "RORY: It is more festive.",
        "[they see Dean on a ladder helping remove the toilet paper]",
        "LORELAI: Good luck tonight!",
        "RORY: Sure, when Dean said he'd call, he always called, but where's the fun in that?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, honey, don't do that.",
        "RORY: Do what?",
        "LORELAI: Compare Dean and Jess, that's not fair. They're different people.",
        "RORY: Clearly. One calls when he says he will and one doesn't.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, for starters, I think you have to realize something \u0096 you were really lucky with Dean. He was an exceptional first boyfriend, and you got spoiled. Most of us didn't have first boyfriends like Dean. Most of us had first boyfriends like Brian Hutchins.",
        "RORY: Brian Hutchins?",
        "LORELAI: Seventh grade, I'm sitting in the library, walks up, asks me to go steady. I say yes. He walks away and I don't see him again until the tenth grade when he tries to sell me a dimebag at the Sadies Hawkins Day dance. And he was way overcharging for it, too.",
        "RORY: That's demented.",
        "LORELAI: Well, that's what most of us had to put up with. Where do you think the Susan Faludi's of the world came from?",
        "RORY: So, you're telling me this is just the way it is, and I have to get used to Jess not calling when he says he will?",
        "LORELAI: No, I'm saying you just have to realize that every guy is different. Give Jess a chance to explain before you freeze him out.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "[they walk into the diner]",
        "RORY: Jess.",
        "JESS: Hey. That table's clean if you want it. [walks away]",
        "LORELAI: Well, I hope that cleared it up for you.",
        "RORY: Not a word. Not even a lame-o apology that is obviously a lie.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, how dare he not lie to you.",
        "LUKE: Finally, two people who don't give a damn about hockey.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, someone's testy.",
        "LUKE: Well, just look at these dippy people with their buttons and their pennants. You'd think the town had never been in a semi-regional playoff before.",
        "RORY: But hasn't it been like forty years?",
        "LUKE: Yeah, for the hockey team, yeah. But back when I was on the track team, we went to state three times in four years and won it twice. Think they made buttons and put up banners? They couldn't care less.",
        "LORELAI: Well, Luke, that's because track is for dorks.",
        "RORY: Yeah, it's true. I'm sorry.",
        "LUKE: Okay, the conversing part of this morning is now over. What do you want?",
        "LORELAI: Jack omelet, bacon on the side.",
        "RORY: Three blueberry and two lemon poppy seed muffins to go. Lane's band is rehearsing at my house. I wanted to bring them something.",
        "LUKE: You got that, Jess?",
        "JESS: Yup.",
        "LUKE: Be right back.",
        "JESS: Five muffins to go.",
        "RORY: Thank you. I'll see you later. [leaves]",
        "JESS: What was that, you guys in a fight or something?",
        "LORELAI: No, you are.",
        "JESS: What are you talking about?",
        "LORELAI: Last night, didn't you guys have plans to do something?",
        "JESS: I don't know. I just said I'd call her after work.",
        "LORELAI: And did you?",
        "JESS: I had to work another shift, I didn't get off until midnight. It was too late to call.",
        "LORELAI: And you couldn't have taken two seconds at work to call and tell her that?",
        "JESS: No.",
        "LORELAI: Really? You don't get breaks? Do you get food, water? Should I get Michael Moore on the phone?",
        "JESS: Whatever. I gotta unload some boxes. [walks away]",
        "LORELAI: Nice talking to you.",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Rory and Lane walk out of the house toward the garage, where the band is practicing]",
        "LANE: See, I knew once my mom found out Dave was part of a Christian trio, it was only a matter of time before she booked him to play at one of her prayer meetings.",
        "RORY: It's perfect. Now your mom's gonna get to know the whole band.",
        "LANE: Not just get to know them, but love them the way she loves Dave.",
        "RORY: Your mom loves Dave?",
        "LANE: She said he's a righteous young man who's proven he can be trusted around antique furniture. In her book, that's pretty close to love.",
        "RORY: Oh, sure.",
        "ZACH: [sings] \"A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing.\" Dude, what's a bulwark?",
        "BRIAN: What?",
        "ZACH: It says, a bulwark never failing.",
        "BRIAN: I think it's a wall.",
        "ZACH: Then why don't they just say that? Bulwark sounds totally gay.",
        "BRIAN: I don't think you're supposed to call a hymn gay. It's like a sin or something.",
        "ZACH: Whatever, man. I'm not saying bulwark.",
        "RORY: So, Dave, Lane just gets to sit back and watch you guys play tonight, huh? You're like a groupie.",
        "DAVE: No, actually, she's got a date.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LANE: Oh, yeah. Remember Young Chui, the guy my mom introduced me to at the wedding? She arranged for him to take me to the hockey game tonight.",
        "RORY: Oh.",
        "DAVE: It's the first of three dates.",
        "RORY: The first of three?",
        "DAVE: Then he's gonna dump her.",
        "RORY: Young Chui, the guy you haven't gone out with yet?",
        "LANE: Yes. And I'll be crushed, making my mom feel so guilty about setting me up with him that she'll have to let me go out with Dave to make up for it.",
        "DAVE: I came up with that twist.",
        "LANE: Dave has a natural gift for subterfuge.",
        "DAVE: Wow, a compliment from the master. [walks away]",
        "LANE: I would've thought of it myself, but I let him take the credit.",
        "RORY: Men sometimes need that.",
        "ZACH: I'm telling you dude, it doesn't make any sense.",
        "BRIAN: Fine, stop yelling at me. I didn't write it.",
        "DAVE: Whoa, whoa. Uh, what's wrong?",
        "ZACH: This stupid song, man. \"For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe.\" I mean, who talks like that, the Pope?",
        "BRIAN: Dude, is any of those lemon poppy seed?",
        "DAVE: Well, can't you update it a little?",
        "ZACH: Sure, man. Just tell me what the hell it means. It's like in Latin or something.",
        "BRIAN: I thought there was gonna be coffee, too.",
        "ZACH: Dude, can you chill out about your freaking elevensees \u0091til we get this song straightened out?",
        "BRIAN: I'm hypoglycemic. If I don't get something in my system, I'm gonna crash.",
        "DAVE: Is abi-death a word?",
        "RORY: But how are you gonna make Young Chui dump you? Just be a really bad date?",
        "LANE: Oh, no, we've already talked to him. He's totally on board.",
        "RORY: Really?",
        "LANE: Oh, yeah. See, he's in love with this Japanese girl named Karen who his parents don't approve of, so he and Karen see each other secretly while his parents keep setting him up with nice Korean girls. He's the male me.",
        "RORY: Gotcha.",
        "LANE: Hey, you and Jess should come with us to the game tonight. It'll be fun.",
        "RORY: Yeah, I'm not sure what we're doing tonight.",
        "ZACH: [sings] \"A mighty fortress is our God, a wall ten stories high. And he helps us when things get bad and the devil tries to hurt us.\"",
        "RORY: What hymn is that?",
        "LANE: I have no idea.",
        "CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN",
        "[Taylor is in the lobby talking to his family]",
        "TAYLOR: If for some reason, you should get separated from the group, you'll find a map on the third page of your welcome packet.",
        "DOUG: Why'd you draw your store so big?",
        "TAYLOR: It just makes it easier to find if you get lost.",
        "DOUG: It's bigger than the school.",
        "MAN 1: And why'd you put all those P's in soda shop? Is that supposed to fancy or something?",
        "MICHEL: You are in room twelve, and your father is \u0096",
        "MAN 2: Are you from France?",
        "MICHEL: Excuse me?",
        "MAN 2: You talk funny. You from France.",
        "MICHEL: Yes. So, as I was saying \u0096",
        "MAN 2: I was in France during the Big One.",
        "MICHEL: Oh, that's nice. So -",
        "MAN 2: Nice? It was a war. What's nice about that?",
        "MICHEL: Of course. So, your father is \u0096",
        "MAN 2: Don't give me that attitude, Frenchy. You'd be speaking German now if it wasn't for me.",
        "LORELAI: Just make sure to have the vans back at 3:45 to take them to the game.",

So it's back to the desert for the Minutemen, perhaps for another forty years. Of course, by then, I'll be seventy years old. A lot of the rest of you will probably be dead. Taylor, you'll be dead.

Mom, please believe me, I know how important your pride is to you, and I never had any intention of robbing you of it. I feel terrible that I caused you any pain. I just wish that once in awhile, you might feel a little bit terrible that you cause me pain. I have pride, too, you know.

Thanksgiving would probably work also. Listen, Dad, I know you're a little upset with Mom right now, and I'm probably out of line in saying this, but you might wanna think about cutting her some slack. She's really missed you lately. I mean, you work so much and then you're helping Gran in your free time, which is totally understandable, but still, it's hard. As much as Gran likes you, she tends to be a littler rough on Mom, and I think Mom just kind of snapped. She'd never do anything like that intentionally. You do know that, Dad, right?",
