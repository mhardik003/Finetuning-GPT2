        "Jess heads out to Venice, California only to learn that his father's community is just as quirky as Stars Hollow. The rift widens between Lorelai and Emily. Luke tells Lorelai that Jess took off for good. Lorelai waits for the right moment to break the news to Rory, who is stressing over finals and graduation. Note: This was to be a backdoor pilot for a spin-off called \"Windward Circle\", that would focus on Jess living in Venice, California and befriending a group of skateboarders. However, The WB did not pick up the series."

        "[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table with books spread open in front of them]",
        "LORELAI: \"Where's the ladies room?\" \"More coffee, please.\" \"Does Antonio Banderas live near here?\"",
        "RORY: We do not need to know how to say \"Does Antonio Banderas live near here?\"",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yes, we do.",
        "RORY: Mom.",
        "LORELAI: When we're in Spain, we need to know how to say, \"Does Antonio Banderas live near here?\" When in France, \"Does Johnny Depp live near here?\"",
        "RORY: When in Rome, \"Does Gore Vidal live near here?\"",
        "LORELAI: You know, you look like me, yet my ways are completely lost on you. Come on, honey, put that down. You've been studying all day.",
        "RORY: I can't put it down, I've got finals coming up.",
        "LORELAI: I know you have finals coming up, but you also have a piece of pie sitting there that you've been completely ignoring.",
        "RORY: Just let me get to the end of this chapter.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, fine. Hey, how important do you think it is to be able to say, \"Help, I'm bleeding from the head\"?",
        "RORY: Just bring the phrase books.",
        "LORELAI: No. If we learn all the phrases we need, then the phrase books are one less thing we have to lug around.",
        "RORY: We will never be able to learn all the phrases in every language that we're going to need. Bring the books.",
        "LORELAI: We can learn enough. Plus, doesn't everybody speak English over there anyway?",
        "RORY: Ugly American, party of one.",
        "LORELAI: Fine, we'll bring the books.",
        "RORY: Okay, five minutes for pie.",
        "LORELAI: Finally.",
        "[Lane walks in and sits down with them]",
        "LANE: They're here, I've got them.",
        "LORELAI: You've got what?",
        "LANE: The brochures for my college.",
        "RORY: You seem chipper.",
        "LANE: I am. I have decided to make this whole Seventh Day Adventist College experience a good one. I'm gonna look on the bright side, find the silver lining, and make myself some lemonade.",
        "LORELAI: Well, good for you.",
        "RORY: The campus looks pretty.",
        "LORELAI: Very pretty.",
        "LANE: It's got two huge parks with gardens and lakes.",
        "LORELAI: Two parks.",
        "LANE: One for boys and one for girls.",
        "RORY: Huh.",
        "LANE: And you know, I had originally thought that this was gonna be a suffocating place with out of date rules and insane restrictions, but boy was I wrong. For example, curfew is up to 9:30. 9:45 if you're going for your Masters. Makeup will be permitted, as long as it identically matches your skin tone. And owning a Rolling Stones CD is no longer grounds for expulsion. You can work the demerits off in the campus clean-up crew.",
        "LORELAI: There's a separate park for boys?",
        "LANE: My life is over.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no, no, I didn't say that.",
        "LANE: You didn't have to. [leaves]",
        "LORELAI: Well, it is over.",
        "RORY: It's not over.",
        "LORELAI: Every kid in that brochure was awkward and panicked. It looked like the Academy Award audience during Michael Moore's speech.",
        "RORY: Hey, why don't you add the phrase \"Just sit there and look pretty\" to that list of yours there, okay? I've gotta go back to studying.",
        "LORELAI: \"Does that sexy guy in the Peugeot ad who had a bit part in Armageddon live near here?\"",

        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai walks down the steps carrying her shoes. She quietly walks to the kitchen and fills up the coffeepot with water, then walks over to the coffee maker as Rory walks out of her bedroom]",
        "RORY: Hey.",
        "LORELAI: [startled] Oh! Oh, God, Rory, you scared me.",
        "RORY: Sorry.",
        "LORELAI: I've been sneaking around here like an idiot trying not to wake you up.",
        "RORY: I've been up for hours.",
        "LORELAI: Why? Did you have a bad dream? The one where you finally meet Christiane Amanpour and she's really stupid?",
        "RORY: No, I realized last night that at this rate, I will never finish all the work I have to do.",
        "LORELAI: What work?",
        "RORY: What work? What work, she asks.",
        "LORELAI: Well, you know me and that dippy Christiane, takes a little while to catch up.",
        "RORY: Here. [hands her a list]",
        "LORELAI: Things to do before graduation. A list, of course. Study for finals, senior breakfast, senior awards, finish final edition of the Franklin, organize a new student government, convince Paris to give up student gavel.",
        "RORY: Oh, and I forgot - man the yearbook distribution table this afternoon at the stupid Senior Palooza. Unbelievable.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I'll be manning the Booster Club Grad Night table at the same time, so we can feel stupid and abused together.",
        "RORY: I can't finish all this and sleep at the same time.",
        "LORELAI: You have to sleep, it's what keeps you pretty.",
        "RORY: Who cares if I'm pretty if I fail my finals?",
        "LORELAI: Okay, you've got this so completely backwards. What is all this?",
        "RORY: Hm? Oh, I found that if I focus too much on one subject, I start to get a little punchy. This way, when I hit Bolshevik Revolution overload, I just shift over here and, oh, hello, Anne Boleyn is going down, and then when that gets too depressing, it's right over to calculus.",
        "LORELAI: Saving the party subject for last, huh?",
        "RORY: This shifting back and forth seems to produce better results.",
        "LORELAI: I think you're pushing yourself too hard.",
        "RORY: I made out a schedule. Every single moment of every single day from now until graduation is accounted for.",
        "LORELAI: You left off the Kiwanis Luncheon.",
        "RORY: I did? Are you sure?",
        "LORELAI: It's on Monday.",
        "RORY: How could I forget the Kiwanis Luncheon? They gave me their scholarship.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yes, a two hundred and fifty dollar scholarship. That'll keep you in microwave popcorn for a week.",
        "RORY: I'll just have to move something around. And I'll have to work Grandma in.",
        "LORELAI: Excuse me?",
        "RORY: Grandma called and asked if I could come over and help her pick out a dress to wear to my graduation.",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "RORY: I have to.",
        "LORELAI: Rory, my mother's been dressing herself for years and she has yet to show up at a function with her bra on the outside of her clothing.",
        "RORY: She asked, I can't say no.",
        "LORELAI: Tell her about the koala bears. She'll understand.",
        "[Luke appears at the back door window and waves to get Lorelai's attention]",
        "RORY: Please stop making fun of them. We need every cent we can get. Yale is expensive.",
        "LORELAI: I know Yale is expensive.",
        "RORY: Well, we haven't heard from Yale financial aid yet.",
        "[Luke gestures for Lorelai to come outside]",
        "LORELAI: We will, relax.",
        "RORY: Well, we had better hear from them soon because I have a deposit to send in for my room and I have a bunch of supplies to buy and I wanna get all of that out of the way before we go to Europe, otherwise I'll be obsessing about it the entire time.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, uh, listen, I'm gonna go out and get the paper.",
        "RORY: Okay, well, don't show it to me because I have no time for recreational reading until June.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, could we move your, uh, chill session from four o'clock tomorrow afternoon to, uh, right now? That'd be great, thanks.",
        "[Lorelai walks out the back door where Luke is waiting for her]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, um, little tip - the whole stalking thing works infinitely better when you don't actually smash your face in the window.",
        "LUKE: I need to talk to you.",
        "LORELAI: Come inside.",
        "LUKE: No, Rory's in there.",
        "LORELAI: Since when are you scared of Rory? 'Cause seriously, Luke, I think you can take her.",
        "LUKE: I just need to tell you something. Can she hear us?",
        "LORELAI: Through the walls? No, I put some kryptonite in her waffles. We're good.",
        "LUKE: Come over here.",
        "LORELAI: You're freaking out the freaks this morning.",
        "LUKE: Jess is gone.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "LUKE: And I don't think he's coming back.",
        "LORELAI: What do you mean gone? Like gone gone?",
        "LUKE: Exactly like gone gone.",
        "LORELAI: But when?",
        "LUKE: Last night, this morning, I don't know. I went up there to get some money out of the safe and I noticed that all of his stuff was gone.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Luke, I'm so sorry.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, well, forget it. I'm through with him. He's eighteen, he can do whatever the hell he wants. He's on his own, I'm through.",
        "LORELAI: Luke.",
        "LUKE: No, it's a relief. That kid was driving me crazy. Let him make his own way from now on. Let him see how far that smart mouth of his gets him without someone watching his back. I couldn't be more relieved. I'm just worried about Rory. I assume she doesn't know.",
        "LORELAI: She hasn't said anything.",
        "LUKE: I can tell her if you want me to.",
        "LORELAI: No, it's okay. I can do it. I just have to figure out when. She's got a lot of things on her mind right now.",
        "LUKE: Well, don't wait too long. She'll notice eventually.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, okay. Well, thanks for coming over.",
        "LUKE: No problem.",
        "LORELAI: Luke?",
        "LUKE: I failed him.",
        "LORELAI: You did not fail him. You supported him, you defended him, you gave him a chance, and if he chose not to take it, there's nothing more you could do.",
        "LUKE: Yeah. Well, I should go.",
        "LORELAI: Do you have any idea where he went?",
        "LUKE: Yeah, I got a pretty good idea.",
        "[Luke leaves. Lorelai walks back into the house through the front door, and Rory walks up to her]",
        "RORY: Hey, there is no chill time scheduled for four o'clock tomorrow, and the one thing I really don't have time for are your jokes, missy. [walks back to kitchen]",
        "LORELAI: Later's good.",
        "CUT TO CALIFORNIA",
        "[Jess gets off a bus and starts walking down the street]",
        "MAN: Do you need some help, friend?",
        "JESS: Nope.",
        "MAN: Lived here 25 years. I can certainly point you in a direction, make your journey easier. [Jess walks away] Enjoy this beautiful day.",
        "JESS: [to himself] I'll have the alfalfa sprouts and a plate of mashed yeast.",
        "[Jess stands on the beach and watches the ocean]",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai pulls up and checks the mailbox. She opens a letter.]",
        "CUT TO INSIDE LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai is on the phone in the living room]",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I've been holding for Mr. Hennings. I'm Lorelai Gilmore. . .oh, great, hi. Listen, um, I just received this letter saying that my daughter did not qualify for financial aid. Rory Gilmore. . .Uh huh. . .Okay, yes, we did recently receive seventy-five thousand dollars, but, uh, here's the thing - that money is gone. I gave it to my parents, so I don't have it anymore, I swear. You could come over here and search me. We could open a bottle of wine and put on some Motown and. . . Uh, yes, that was very inappropriate. Look, um, I owed my parents that money because they helped me put Rory through Chilton, and I wanted her to go to Chilton so that she could get into. . .well, Harvard, but then Harvard became Yale - long story - and now that she's gotten into Yale, I paid them back for Chilton. Just kind of a funny, wacky circle we could all laugh about someday. . . Yes, but, since I don't have the money anymore, it just seems like it shouldn't count. There must be something we can do. I mean, Rory is the most deserving kid there is, just seriously. You know, I don't know if you know the Kiwanis, but they gave her their scholarship and. . .mmhmm. . .I understand. . .okay. . .well, we'll just have to figure something out. . . thank you. Goodbye.",

        "[a woman is standing on the roof of the house]",
        "SASHA: [to dogs] Pipe down! [to Jess] You selling something?",
        "JESS: No. Does Jimmy Mariano live here?",
        "SASHA: Does he owe you money?",
        "JESS: No, I'm his. . .Jess. I'm Jess.",
        "SASHA: Jess?",
        "[a dog starts barking]",
        "JESS: Jess Marian -",
        "SASHA: Frodo, back off now! I'm sorry, what were you saying?",
        "JESS: I just wanna see Jimmy, okay?",
        "SASHA: Hey, did you ever see The Wizard of Oz?",
        "JESS: Yes.",
        "SASHA: Remember when they go to the Emerald City and they ring the bell and the guy with the beard stuck his head out and they said that they wanted to see the wizard, and he said no, and they said, 'She's got the ruby slippers', and he said 'Well, that's a horse of a different color. Come on in.'",
        "JESS: Yes.",
        "SASHA: Well, I'm the guy with the beard and I'm saying the no unless you can come up with the ruby slippers.",
        "JESS: I'm his son.",
        "SASHA: His son?",
        "JESS: Yes, his son.",
        "SASHA: Well, that's a horse of a different color. Come on in.",
        "JESS: Do they bite?",
        "SASHA: Just those two. [walks away]",
        "JESS: Which two? Hey, which two? Great. I swear I will bite you back.",
        "[He walks into the yard. The woman walks over to greet him]",
        "SASHA: I'm sorry, I didn't know you were coming.",
        "JESS: Neither did I.",
        "SASHA: I'm Sasha. This is Angus, Chowder, Rufus, Legolas, Caligula, Mudball, General Lee, Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis and Spot. Jimmy's not here right now.",
        "JESS: Okay, well, I can just hang out, walk around for awhile. Just tell me what time he gets home.",
        "SASHA: Why don't you come in? I'll call his work.",
        "JESS: Oh, well. . .",
        "[they walk inside]",
        "JESS: You have a lot of pets.",
        "SASHA: Ah, they're not all mine.",
        "JESS: No?",
        "SASHA: No, some of 'em followed me home, some of 'em hang out, some of 'em just needed a place to crash. They drive Jimmy crazy, actually, but what can you do? Someone's gotta take care of 'em, right? I'm just gonna try and track him down, so just wander.",
        "[Sasha walks to a phone and picks it up]",
        "SASHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. [she dials a number] Okay. Lee, hi, I'm looking for Jimmy. . . okay, I'll hold. . .",
        "[Jess looks around the house]",
        "JESS: Clowns, cats, dogs. I wonder where his tap shoes are.",
        "[He walks into another room and looks around. He opens a cabinet door and finds a young girl reading inside]",
        "JESS: Whoa!",
        "[Sasha comes to the doorway]",
        "SASHA: He wasn't at work, but his guy said he'll be back any second. Lil, Koko's gonna come over and stay with you while I'm gone, okay? And put those books back in there when you're done, I mean it. Ready?",

        "LOUISE: No problem.",

        "EMILY: When are you coming over? I need to discuss what to wear to your graduation. I thought about a suit.",
        "RORY: A suit seems nice.",
        "EMILY: But perhaps it's too formal.",
        "RORY: Formal's fine.",
        "EMILY: Well, what are your friends' families wearing?",

        "RORY: I have to go.",
        "LORELAI: You can't come over and talk for one second?",
        "RORY: The minute I walk into that room, I'm suddenly gonna have to sign yearbooks, and since I'm severely crunched for time, I'm gonna have to resort to classic clams like, \"Hey, have a good summer. Let's keep in touch. Best friends forever,\" and I do not wanna be that person. Plus, Paris will immediately shanghai me and give me a million things to do.",
        "LORELAI: You know what, you need to stop being intimidated by that girl. You're going to college for God's sake. You need to be able to stand up for yourself and say, you know, \"Paris, go. . .\"",

        "PARIS: We're not even set up yet. The box isn't out, the tickets aren't in order. Where's the list?",
        "LORELAI: Uh, it's uh. . .in my purse.",
        "PARIS: Well, terrific. I can't think of a better place for the list to be except, oh, maybe out here on the table where we could actually look at it.",
        "LORELAI: Your hair is really shiny.",
        "PARIS: I'm going to go make the rounds. I'll be back in a minute. Have you seen Rory?",

        "WOMAN: Everything's fine.",
        "SASHA: I love that. Give Riley a kiss. [to Jess] Then I came to my senses and ran for the hills but I got Lily so I win, ha ha. Short cut. Anyhow, I met Jimmy about five and a half years ago, but Lily's just crazy about him, so. . .[to man] . . . Ronnie, I found your keys again.",
        "RONNIE: Oh, good. Thank you, baby doll.",
        "SASHA: You have got to sew that hole in your pocket up, I mean it. Today, drop your coat by my house. I'll do it for you if you don't have the time. [to Jess] Got any brothers or sisters?",
        "JESS: Apparently not.",
        "SASHA: Lily submitted a written request for a brother by the end of this year, but I think I should be married before we have any kids.",

I gave it to my parents, so I don't have it anymore, I swear. You could come over here and search me. We could open a bottle of wine and put on some Motown and. . . Uh, yes, that was very inappropriate. Look, um, I owed my parents that money because they helped me put Rory through Chilton, and I wanted her to go to Chilton so that she could get into. . .well, Harvard, but then Harvard became Yale - long story - and now that she's gotten into Yale, I paid them back for Chilton. Just kind of a funny, wacky circle we could all laugh about someday. . . Yes, but, since I don't have the money anymore, it just seems like it shouldn't count. There must be something we can do. I mean, Rory is the most deserving kid there is, just seriously. You know, I don't know if you know the Kiwanis, but they gave her their scholarship and. . .mmhmm. . .I understand. . .okay. . .well, we'll just have to figure something out. . . thank you. Goodbye."
