        "OPEN IN LORELAI'S FRONT YARD",
        "[Lorelai and Rory are staring at their garage]",
        "RORY: Well.",
        "LORELAI: I'd say three years.",
        "RORY: I'd say more like four.",
        "LORELAI: What? It has not been four years since we've stepped foot inside our own garage.",
        "RORY: It was when we got the Jeep.",
        "LORELAI: That wasn't. . .yes, it was.",
        "RORY: And even then, I think we only got as far as opening the door before something flew out and scared you.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, it scared me while you stood by calmly like Dr. Dolittle chatting with the bat.",
        "RORY: It was a bat, wasn't it?",
        "LORELAI: Wearing an OzzFest T-shit, I believe.",
        "RORY: Will the man never be able to live that down?",
        "LORELAI: Well, Joe Namath will forever be wearing pantyhose.",
        "RORY: True, very true.",
        "LORELAI: So, uh, what do we do about the bat cave?",
        "RORY: Well, we did promise Lane that her band could rehearse here.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, we did.",
        "RORY: And they'll probably need to actually get in there to do so.",
        "LORELAI: So I guess we're going in.",
        "RORY: I guess we are.",
        "LORELAI: All right. On three \u0096 one, two, three.",
        "[They open the garage doors]",
        "RORY: Ah!",
        "LORELAI: What, what is it?",
        "RORY: Those are the boxes from our attic that you were supposed to give away two years ago.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RORY: I spent three days boxing all the stuff in the attic and you were going to call a charity and get someone to pick them up.",
        "LORELAI: I made an appointment, the guy didn't show.",
        "RORY: He didn't?",
        "LORELAI: No, I don't think.",
        "RORY: Unbelievable.",
        "LORELAI: Look, I got bored after sitting there two hours, so I left a note saying the stuff was in the garage and he could leave a receipt, and I went to get some coffee.",
        "RORY: These guys aren't just allowed to go into someone's garage.",
        "LORELAI: Well, the note said it was okay.",
        "RORY: Well, how did he know that the note was authentic?",
        "LORELAI: I wrote it on Powerpuff Girls stationery. Who'd he think was setting him up, Hello Kitty?",
        "RORY: I can't believe how much junk we have.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, these are \u0096 these are souvenirs from our life's journey, girly girl. This is not junk. Okay, this is junk, and that over there is junk. All right, basically everything I'm looking at is, yeah, junk.",
        "RORY: We're pack rats.",
        "LORELAI: We're Sanford and Son. Yuck, bye bye. [throws a stuffed ball out of the garage]",
        "RORY: Wait! [catches the ball]",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RORY: Hug-a-World!",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RORY: Hug-a-World, it's my Hug-a-World.",
        "LORELAI: Where's the world?",
        "RORY: It's faded.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, wait, I can see something.",
        "RORY: Canada.",
        "LORELAI: Canada, nice. Okay.",
        "RORY: What are you doing?",
        "LORELAI: I'm throwing it out.",
        "RORY: You can't throw out Hug-a-World.",
        "LORELAI: I'm not throwing out Hug-a-World, I'm throwing out Hug-a-Canada.",
        "RORY: I learned my seven continents on Hug-a-World, don't you remember? We used to squeeze it as tight as we could and then wherever our pinkies would end up, that's where we were going to go together when I grew up.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, many a trip to Uzbekistan was planned that way.",
        "RORY: We can clean him up and keep him, can't we?",
        "LORELAI: Throw him outside and I'll see what I can do.",
        "RORY: Thank you.",
        "LORELAI: If I clean up Hug-a-World, does that cancel out me not getting rid of the boxers?",
        "RORY: I'll consider it a wash.",
        "LORELAI: How about if I chase it and bring it back?",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Hug-a-World would like to see the world.",
        "RORY: It's moving.",
        "LORELAI: There's something living there besides Canadians.",
        "RORY: I hugged it, I hugged it really tight.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, you did.",
        "RORY: I have to shower! [runs away]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, hey, hey, what about the rest of the garage? Rory! Hey, how \u0091bout if Lane's band rehearses in the kitchen? We don't use that either.",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "[There is construction going on outside. Luke tries to take an order over the noise]",
        "LUKE: Can I take. . .Can I take. . .What can I get. . . That's it. [goes outside]",
        "TAYLOR: I specifically requested a carved arch above the door.",
        "TOM: It's a blueprint, Taylor.",
        "TAYLOR: Yes, Tom, I know it's a blueprint.",
        "LUKE: Taylor!",
        "TAYLOR: One second, Luke. I know it's a blueprint, Tom, but if I don't see a carved archway here, then I don't expect to see a carved archway there, and if I don't see an archway there, then you won't see a paycheck here. Are we clear?",
        "TOM: Get away from my saw, Taylor.",
        "LUKE: What the hell is going on?",
        "TAYLOR: I'm renovating your building. You know that very well.",
        "LUKE: I also know that the renovation is supposed to be going on over there inside the building.",
        "TAYLOR: There is plenty of room to move around if you turn sideways.",
        "LUKE: I'm gonna punch you in the nose.",
        "TAYLOR: I have every right to make the necessary renovations to the building that I am paying good money to lease.",
        "LUKE: Taylor, if any other person in this town pulled a stunt like this in front of your market, you'd have them arrested.",
        "TAYLOR: I have acquired all the necessary permits to do exactly what I'm doing, and all of this has been looked over and approved by the town magistrate.",
        "LUKE: You're the town magistrate!",
        "TAYLOR: And as such, if you have any complaints about me, you may take them up with me.",
        "TOM: Get him away from my saw.",
        "LUKE: Get him away from my diner.",
        "TAYLOR: By the way, Luke, I noticed you hadn't returned any of my lawyer's calls about the lease agreement. Now we have to set up an appointment to see that those papers get signed.",
        "LUKE: Forget it. I'm not going through any lawyer. You want those papers signed, you pick them up and you walk them over to me. Then, I'll sign them.",
        "TAYLOR: Luke, this is business. It needs to be done properly and legally.",
        "LUKE: It's a standard lease form, Taylor. I bought it at Office Depot.",
        "TAYLOR: All the more reason to have a professional take a little looksee, huh? I mean, there's a reason they say good lawyers make for good neighbors.",
        "LUKE: Who the hell said that?",
        "TAYLOR: Oh, everybody says that. Okay, now back to work. Tom, let's take another look at this archway, shall we?",
        "TOM: Get away from my saw, Taylor.",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT YARD",
        "[Lane and the band are setting up in the garage]",
        "LORELAI: I already talked to the neighbors. Just make sure you keep the doors closed, and the music must stop by eight.",
        "LANE: Don't worry, I have to be home by six.",
        "ZACH: We'll be done by eight, don't you worry.",
        "LORELAI: I won't.",
        "ZACH: Okay, okay, okay, Lorelai, okay.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, so, um, Rory showed you the key. Uh, you're welcome to anything in the kitchen, which is nothing, but, uh, the water's yours for the taking. Just replace the bottle if it's out.",
        "ZACH: You ask, I will obey.",
        "LORELAI: Super.",
        "BRIAN: I'm out!",
        "LORELAI: He's out! I'll get you some more!",
        "LANE: Oh, no, no, don't worry about it. I'll get it.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. Oh, excuse me. Do you need any help?",
        "RORY: No.",
        "LORELAI: Do you need any help, please?",
        "RORY: I'm good, Pamela Des Barres.",
        "LORELAI: When did you turn on Mommy?",
        "RORY: What? He's cute.",
        "LORELAI: Rory.",
        "RORY: And you know, if you latch on now, you're totally entitled to half of everything when he dumps you after he's famous.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, um, since you don't need any help, simply a new place to live, I'm gonna just go.",
        "ZACH: Listen. . .",
        "LORELAI: You're back, okay, hi.",
        "ZACH: We're gonna be playing a gig next month, and I think you'd really get into it.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, well, I'd love to get into it, Zach, but see, I have this medical condition where I can't listen to music.",
        "ZACH: You can't?",
        "LORELAI: No. My ears, the hollow tubey thing inside is very tiny and it will literally explode if I listen to anything loud and musical.",
        "ZACH: That sucks.",
        "LORELAI: I know. Thanks for the invite, I'm sure it's gonna be great. Uh, so, uh, you guys have a good rehearsal. I'm gonna go on inside and write to Tipper. Great gal. See you guys later.",
        "RORY: Bye Pam.",
        "ZACH: She is some kind of fine.",
        "BRIAN: Zach, some help would be great.",
        "ZACH: Relax.",
        "LANE: I still can't believe you guys are letting us rehearse here.",
        "RORY: You can thank us in the liner notes.",
        "LANE: Right under our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.",
        "RORY: That's some good billing. So, are you guys actually playing a gig next month?",
        "LANE: Abby Berland's birthday party. Her parents are letting her have a band.",
        "RORY: That'd be great.",
        "LANE: Cross your fingers she doesn't wreck the car again and her mother doesn't cancel it before we get to play.",
        "RORY: I'll hide the keys myself.",
        "BRIAN: Okay, I'm done.",
        "DAVE: Me too.",
        "ZACH: Let's do this.",
        "DAVE: Listen, Lane, we need to talk a sec.",
        "LANE: Sure.",
        "DAVE: Now that we finally have a real rehearsal space, we can get serious about the sound.",
        "LANE: Absolutely.",
        "DAVE: Which means that I'm gonna need you to really step it up a little.",
        "LANE: Oh.",
        "DAVE: I mean, you've got the potential, but you're sloppy. I need a clean roll on the toms but powerful, like Moon.",
        "LANE: Okay.",
        "DAVE: I know you're a girl, but I need you to play like a guy.",
        "LANE: I understand.",
        "DAVE: And if you can't, if that's too hard. . .",
        "LANE: No, that's not too hard. I'll be better, I promise.",
        "DAVE: Okay.",
        "[Dave walks away. Rory walks up to Lane]",
        "RORY: Okay, please take this the way it's intended, but I am going to kick Dave in the shins repeatedly for the next hour and a half.",
        "LANE: Why?",
        "RORY: Why? Did you hear the way he was talking to you? \"Play like a guy, Lane.\" Well, cry like a girl, Dave! What? Why are you smiling like that?",
        "LANE: He fooled you.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LANE: We thought the other guys might be catching on about me and Dave so we came up with this plan.",
        "RORY: That he become a jerk?",
        "LANE: Yes. If the other guys see him talking down to me like that, they will totally be thrown off track.",
        "RORY: Okay, but doesn't it bother you to hear him talk to you like that?",
        "LANE: No way. Believe me, he knows I play better, harder, Moonier than any guy they could possibly find, plus I smell better.",
        "RORY: Okay, as long as you're fine with it.",
        "LANE: I am, I'm fine with it.",
        "DAVE: And also Lane, I need four strong downbeats, not two strong ones and two whatever ones. You set the tone, Lane. If you suck, we suck.",
        "LANE: God, he's wonderful.",
        "CUT TO COFFEE SHOP",
        "[Lorelai is sitting at a table as Alex walks over with two little coffee cups]",
        "ALEX: Okay, now this is the Sumatra blend. It's supposed to be a little sharper than the Colombian.",
        "LORELAI: You know, this is pretty much what I thought heaven would look like. There might have been a unicorn in the corner, but basically \u0096 yeah, this is it. Um, so I've had fifteen of these tiny coffees.",
        "ALEX: Yes, you have.",
        "LORELAI: And you're telling me that all this tasting is completely free?",
        "ALEX: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: So I'm a cheap date.",
        "ALEX: Well, the tasting is free, but I have to promise to stock my coffee chain from this warehouse, so actually this date is costing me about eleven thousand dollars a month.",
        "LORELAI: Geez, I hope I'm worth it.",
        "ALEX: So far, so good.",
        "LORELAI: So you were telling me about Hillary and Jeff.",
        "ALEX: Right. Well, they live with their mom, but I get them quite a bit. They both recently started soccer because apparently it's the law.",
        "LORELAI: I know. Rory's still got an outstanding warrant on that one. So, how old are they?",
        "ALEX: Six and nine.",
        "LORELAI: Good ages.",
        "ALEX: Haven't really hit a bad one yet.",
        "LORELAI: Me either. Although, with Rory, I think it's gonna be forty-three.",
        "ALEX: Really?",
        "LORELAI: Not sure why, just have a feeling that's the year she's getting the mohawk. Mm, we like sharper. When you guys open your coffee place, this must be on the menu.",
        "ALEX: Yeah? Mm, that's sharper.",
        "LORELAI: So, let's see, we've covered work, kids. . .uh, shall we move onto hobbies?",
        "ALEX: Not a hobby guy.",
        "LORELAI: Hallelujah.",
        "ALEX: Most of the time I'm working, with the kids, or I'm charming the chicks with the coffee. And then a few times a year, I'll go camping or fishing. I actually really love that stuff.",
        "LORELAI: Oh yeah?",
        "ALEX: Absolutely. How about you?",
        "LORELAI: Ah, there's a reason they call it the great outdoors, right?",
        "ALEX: I was actually thinking of doing a little fishing this Saturday.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, that sounds like fun.",
        "ALEX: This great place, beautiful, perfect fishing. You wanna come?",
        "LORELAI: Huh?",
        "ALEX: I'd love to take you.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yeah, sure. That would be nice.",
        "ALEX: Great, it's a date.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, it is a date. It is a fishing date.",
        "ALEX: Ready to try another? I hear there's one from Peru that comes with a Surgeon's General warning.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, if that last one didn't kill me, nothing will.",
        "ALEX: Be right back.",
        "CUT TO BUS STOP",
        "[Rory gets off the bus; Lane runs up to her]",
        "LANE: Rory! Rory! The numbers are all adding up, the planets are aligning, and I am going to my senior prom!",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LANE: Yes!",
        "RORY: How?",
        "LANE: Because I am brilliant. See, my mom was in a good mood today because she made a big sale \u0096 a dining room table and eight chairs, none of which matched, that have been hanging around the shop since I was four.",
        "RORY: Oh, I'm gonna miss those.",
        "LANE: Get over it. Anyway, I sat her down and I told her that I really wanted to go to the prom. And I know she doesn't approve of such things, but if she lets me go, we will do it her way.",
        "RORY: But her way would be not to let you go.",
        "LANE: Yes, she said that also. But then I went on to clarify that if she lets me go, she would get full dress approval, full chaperone approval, I promise not to actually dance at the prom, and whatever boy I go with will be required to attend at least four family dinners before she signs off on him being my escort.",
        "RORY: Nice move on using the word escort instead of the word date.",
        "LANE: The subliminal is half the battle, Rory.",
        "RORY: Go on, go on.",
        "LANE: So, she sat there, took it all in, and after a really long pause, she looks at me and says, \"Maybe.\"",
        "RORY: You got a maybe from Mrs. Kim.",
        "LANE: I got a maybe from Mrs. Kim.",
        "[they walk into the beauty supply store]",
        "LANE: Okay, let's start with base.",
        "RORY: Right. Now, we are talking Dave taking you to the prom, right?",
        "LANE: Of course. My mom loves him. Last week she let him sit in our pew.",
        "RORY: No.",
        "LANE: She made me move.",
        "RORY: You've been replaced.",
        "LANE: I'd be offended if I weren't so busy doing a happy dance. It's all working out so perfectly. By the time she says yes, she'll love him even more and then when I say I wanna go to the prom with him, it'll be like she picked him out herself.",
        "RORY: You are brilliant. Hey, Kirk, is this waterproof?",
        "KIRK: Water-resistant.",
        "RORY: Thanks.",
        "LANE: You know, she asked Dave to play at the wedding this weekend.",
        "RORY: I thought I was the only non-Korean allowed at the Kim family weddings.",
        "LANE: Don't be hurt. You have been to so many of these weddings, you are an honorary member of the clan now.",
        "RORY: I appreciate that. So, tell me, your cousin getting married Saturday, what's his story?",
        "LANE: James. Very quiet, kind of skulky, couldn't meet anyone here, so his family arranged to have a girl shipped over from the old country.",
        "RORY: I hope they cut air holes in the box.",
        "LANE: She doesn't speak a word of English and she's never met him.",
        "RORY: Hm. Well, then she's gonna need some sparkles.",
        "LANE: Okay, I think that's it.",
        "RORY: Let's go. Can you imagine marrying someone you didn't know?",
        "LANE: Are you kidding? Used clothes still skeeve me out a little.",
        "KIRK: Will this be all?",
        "RORY: Yes. I like your display Kirk.",
        "KIRK: It is fun, isn't it? Okay, that's $40.42.",
        "LANE: Here.",
        "KIRK: I'm also including a few samples, a facial scrub and a honey mask. Very soothing, very healing.",
        "RORY: That's very nice.",
        "KIRK: Thank you for coming, and call me and tell me how you like that mask.",
        "RORY: We will.",
        "[they walk outside]",
        "LANE: Okay, the wedding's at four, so how about you come over at one and we'll get her ready?",
        "RORY: Deal.",
        "LANE: You know, Rory, I feel good. I feel like everything's going my way this time.",
        "RORY: I hope so.",
        "LANE: No, it is, I can feel it. Lane Kim is going to her prom.",
        "RORY: Maybe.",
        "CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN",
        "[Sookie is frosting a cake, Lorelai is sitting next to her]",
        "LORELAI: Dumb, dumb, dumb.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, come on.",
        "LORELAI: Sure, I fish. I also bodysurf and walk on the moon without a space suit.",
        "SOOKIE: You were trying to impress him.",
        "LORELAI: Ugh.",
        "SOOKIE: What ugh? You like him.",
        "LORELAI: I like him, but I'm not sixteen. I don't lie to guys to make them like me. I just got stuck when he said fishing and camping, and I was trying to be nice and not say, \"Fishing? Great \u0096 cold, wet, and smelly. My three favorite things after those witches from Macbeth.\"",
        "SOOKIE: Honey, we all do it. When Jackson and I first started dating, we went to this pickling festival, and he wore a shirt with a giant frog on it. So I'm trying to make conversation and I say, \"Hey, cute frog.\" And he says, \"You like frogs?\" and I say, \"I love frogs!\" So, for our six-month anniversary, he gives me a frog figurine.",
        "LORELAI: Aw.",
        "SOOKIE: And then when Christmas came, he gave me another frog figurine. And then he told his family what to get me, and all of a sudden. . .",
        "LORELAI: Your frog collection!",
        "SOOKIE: I'm the frog girl.",
        "LORELAI: You never told him you don't love frogs?",
        "SOOKIE: No. He has the best time buying them for me, so I just let him buy them.",
        "LORELAI: That's sweet. Maybe I could go fishing. Maybe. Once.",
        "SOOKIE: Tell me about Alex.",
        "LORELAI: Well, he owns an iron company. They do gates and statues, big fancy stuff. He's divorced, he has two kids he's crazy about. He's nice, he drinks a lot of coffee. It's all good, it all works.",
        "SOOKIE: So?",
        "LORELAI: So. . .I'm going fishing. I'm the fish girl.",
        "SOOKIE: Frog girl welcomes you to the club!",
        "CUT TO CHILTON",
        "[Students are gathering for the student council meeting]",
